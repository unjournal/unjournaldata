Our\ndataset has grown substantially -- from a few dozen evaluations in July\n2024 to 49 papers and 95 evaluations today. With\nthis larger dataset, we can now conduct more robust analyses and draw\nstronger conclusions about patterns in our evaluation process.\n\nThis update expands on the previous analysis in several ways:\n\n-   **Interactive visualizations**: Plotly-based charts with hover tooltips to identify papers, filter data, and reorder axes\n-   **Expanded PCA analysis**: We now examine how much variance each\n    principal component explains and provide deeper interpretation of\n    what each component captures\n-   **Enhanced IRR analysis**: More detailed examination of\n    Krippendorff's alpha values (interval, ratio, and ordinal), plus expanded analysis of credible interval overlap\n-   **Journal tier analysis**: New section examining evaluators'\n    predictions about journal placement, including statistical tests\n-   **Research area breakdowns**: Analysis by cause/research area for key metrics\n-   **Correlation matrices**: Within-rater correlations to examine redundancy\n-   **Criteria redundancy**: Which evaluation dimensions are most closely related\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Note on this analysis\n\nThis blog post is preliminary and was created with assistance from Claude Code\n(Anthropic's AI assistant) under the orchestration of David Reinstein,\nbuilding on inspirational earlier work by David Hugh-Jones. While the\nstatistical methods are standard and the code has been tested, the analysis\nand interpretations merit careful scrutiny. We welcome feedback, corrections,\nand suggestions for improvement. Please review the code and results critically\nbefore drawing strong conclusions.\n:::\n\n## About the data\n\nPapers[^uj-data-update-2025-1] can be suggested for evaluation either by\nUnjournal insiders, or by outsiders. The Unjournal then selects some\npapers for evaluation.\n\n[^uj-data-update-2025-1]: Actually we don't just evaluate academic\n    papers, but I'll use \"papers\" for short.\n\nEach paper is typically evaluated by two evaluators, though some have\nmore or less than two. Getting two or more of every measure is useful,\nbecause it lets us check evaluations against each other.\n\nWe ask evaluators two kinds of quantitative questions. First, there are\ndifferent measures of *paper quality*. Here they are, along with some\nsnippets from our [guidelines for\nevaluators](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#quantitative-metrics):\n\n-   *Overall assessment*: \"Judge the quality of the research\n    heuristically. Consider all aspects of quality, credibility,\n    importance to knowledge production, and importance to practice.\"\n-   *Advancing our knowledge and practice*: \"To what extent does the\n    project contribute to the field or to practice, particularly in ways\n    that are relevant to global priorities and impactful\n    interventions?...\"\n-   *Methods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness*: \"Are\n    the methods used well-justified and explained; are they a reasonable\n    approach to answering the question(s) in this context? Are the\n    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results and methods\n    likely to be robust to reasonable changes in the underlying\n    assumptions?...\"\n-   *Logic and communication*: \"Are the goals and questions of the paper\n    clearly expressed? Are concepts clearly defined and referenced? Is\n    the reasoning 'transparent'? Are assumptions made explicit? Are all\n    logical steps clear and correct? Does the writing make the argument\n    easy to follow?\"\n-   *Open, collaborative, replicable science*: \"This covers several\n    considerations: Replicability, reproducibility, data integrity...\n    Consistency... Useful building blocks: Do the authors provide tools,\n    resources, data, and outputs that might enable or enhance future\n    work and meta-analysis?\"\n-   *Real-world relevance*: \"Are the assumptions and setup realistic and\n    relevant to the real world?\"\n-   *Relevance to global priorities*: \"Could the paper's topic and\n    approach potentially help inform [global priorities, cause\n    prioritization, and high-impact\n    interventions](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/the-field-and-ea-gp-research)?\n\nEach of these questions is meant to be a percentile scale, 0-100%, where\nthe percentage captures the paper's place in the distribution of the\nreference group (\"all serious research in the same area that you have\nencountered in the last three years\").[^uj-data-update-2025-2] So, for\nexample, a score of 70% would mean the paper is better than 70% of\npapers in the reference group.\n\n[^uj-data-update-2025-2]: This 'reference group percentile'\n    interpretation was introduced around the end of 2023; before this\n    evaluators were given a different description of the ratings\n    interval.\n\nAs well as asking for each question (the midpoint or median of the\nevaluator's belief distribution), we also ask for lower and upper bounds\nof a 90% credible interval. Our [guidelines](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#how-do-i-come-up-with-these-intervals-discussion-and-guidance)\nnote that evaluators should aim to estimate the **true percentile** for the paper,\naccounting for both their own uncertainty and the variation they expect\namong informed experts.\n\nNext, we ask two practical questions about publication:\n\n-   \"What journal ranking tier *should* this work be published in?\"\n\n-   \"What journal ranking tier *will* this work be published in?\"\n\nTiers are measured from 0 (\"won't publish/little to no value\") up to 5\n(\"top journal\"). Again, we ask for both an estimate and a 90% credible\ninterval. We allow non-integer scores between 0 and 5.\n\nThe last question is especially interesting, because unlike all the\nothers, it has an observable ground truth. Eventually, papers do or do\nnot get published in specific journals, and there is often a consensus\nabout which journals count as e.g. \"top\".\n\n## Sanity checks\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# We suppress warnings about \"no non-missing arguments to min/max\":\nsuppressWarnings({\n  problem_ratings <- ratings |>\n    filter(criteria %in% all_dimensions) |>\n    summarize(.by = c(research, evaluator),\n      all_same     = min(middle_rating, na.rm = TRUE) == max(middle_rating,\n                                                             na.rm = TRUE),\n      all_same_lo  = min(lower_CI, na.rm = TRUE) == max(lower_CI, na.rm = TRUE),\n      all_same_hi  = min(upper_CI, na.rm = TRUE) == max(upper_CI, na.rm = TRUE),\n      degen_ci     = sum(criteria %in% qual_dimensions &\n                         lower_CI == upper_CI,\n                         na.rm = TRUE),\n      uninf_ci     = sum(criteria %in% qual_dimensions &\n                         upper_CI - lower_CI >= 100,\n                         na.rm = TRUE),\n      bad_ci       = sum(\n                         lower_CI > upper_CI |\n                         lower_CI > middle_rating |\n                         upper_CI < middle_rating,\n                         na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n})\n\nn_straightliners    <- sum(problem_ratings$all_same)\nn_straightliners_lo <- sum(problem_ratings$all_same_lo)\nn_straightliners_hi <- sum(problem_ratings$all_same_hi)\n\nn_degenerate    <- sum(problem_ratings$degen_ci)\nn_uninformative <- sum(problem_ratings$uninf_ci)\nn_misspecified  <- sum(problem_ratings$bad_ci)\n```\n:::\n\n\nStraightliners are evaluators who give the same score for every\nquestion. For the midpoints, we have 0\nstraightliners out of 95 evaluations. We also check if people\nstraightline lower bounds of the credible intervals\n(0 straightliners) and upper bounds\n(0 straightliners).\n\nEvaluators might also give \"degenerate\" credible intervals, with the\nlower bound equal to the upper bound; uninformatively wide intervals,\nwith the lower and upper bounds equal to 0% and 100%; or simply\nmisspecified intervals, e.g. with the lower bound higher than the\nmidpoint or the upper bound below it. We don't look at whether the\njournal ratings CIs were degenerate or uninformative, because the 0-5\nscale makes such CIs more plausible. Out of 851\nconfidence intervals, 6 were degenerate,\n0 were uninformative and 10 were\nmisspecified.\n\nOverall, these results suggest that most evaluators are providing\nthoughtful, differentiated responses to our quantitative questions.\n\n## Inter-rater reliability\n\nWe have no ground truth of whether a given paper scores high or low on\nour 7 dimensions. But because we usually have multiple evaluations per\npaper, we can take an indirect route. If two evaluators' scores are\ncorrelated with reality, they will also correlate with each other. The\nconverse does not necessarily hold: evaluators' scores might be\ncorrelated because they both have similar prejudices or both\nmisinterpret the paper in the same way. All the same, high \"inter-rater\nreliability\" (IRR) should increase our confidence that our scores are\nmeasuring something real.\n\nIRR is complex. The basic form of most IRR statistics is\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_a - p_e}{1 - p_e}\n$$\n\nwhere $p_a$ is the proportion of the time that two raters agree, and\n$p_e$ is the amount of agreement you'd expect by chance if both raters\nare choosing independently.\n\nWhy not use $p_a$ directly? Well, for example, suppose our raters pick\nan expected journal tier at random, from 0 to 5 inclusive. Clearly\nthere's no reliability: the data is just random noise. But one time in\nsix, both raters will agree, simply by chance. So we need to adjust for\nthe expected amount of agreement. To do this most measures use the\nmarginal distributions of the ratings: in our example, a 1 in 6 chance\nof each number from 0 to 5, giving $p_e = 1/6$. Krippendorff's alpha is\na widely accepted statistic that corrects for $p_e$ and also defines\n\"agreement\" appropriately for different levels of measurement.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Choosing a reliability statistic\n\nThere are many ways to measure inter-rater reliability. We use Krippendorff's\nalpha because we are broadly persuaded by the argument in Krippendorff and\nHayes (2005) that it measures reliability better than the alternatives. We\nalso have some constraints: at present, we have many evaluators, each contributing\nonly one or two evaluations. That gives us too little information to estimate\nper-individual biases. In future, if some evaluators do many evaluations for\nus, we might revisit this question.\n\nKrippendorff's alpha can be calculated for different measurement levels:\n**interval**, **ratio**, and **ordinal**. For our percentile ratings (0-100%),\nwe focus primarily on the **interval** scale, which treats equal-sized\ndifferences the same throughout the scale. We also report ratio (which\nhas a meaningful zero) and ordinal (which only considers rank order) alphas\nfor comparison.\n\nKrippendorff's alpha handles missing data elegantly, so we use all available\nratings regardless of how many evaluators rated each paper.\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tbl-kripp-alpha .cell tbl-cap='Krippendorff\\'s alpha for each dimension (49 papers, 95 evaluations).

Ratio alpha\nadditionally assumes a meaningful zero point, while ordinal alpha only\nconsiders whether one rating is higher than another.\n\nKrippendorff's alpha values typically range from 0 (no agreement beyond chance)\nto 1 (perfect agreement). Values above 0.667 are often considered acceptable\nfor high-stakes decisions, while values above 0.8 indicate strong reliability.\n\nOur interval alpha values suggest moderate agreement across dimensions. The\nquality dimensions (overall assessment, methods, etc.) generally show reliability\nin the 0.4-0.6 range, which is typical for subjective expert judgments.\nThis level of agreement is meaningful -- it's well above what we'd expect\nby chance -- but also reveals that different evaluators do bring\ndifferent perspectives to the same work.\n\nThe journal tier questions show lower\nreliability to the quality dimensions. This might reflect genuine uncertainty\nabout publication outcomes, or differences in evaluators' mental models of\njournal prestige.\n\n### Credible interval overlap\n\nBecause we have each rater's 90% credible interval, we can also ask a\nslightly different question: do raters' credible intervals capture\nother evaluators' best estimates? That is, is rater 1's midpoint estimate\nwithin rater 2's credible interval, and vice versa?\n\nAccording to our [guidelines](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#how-do-i-come-up-with-these-intervals-discussion-and-guidance),\nevaluators should construct intervals that capture their uncertainty about\nthe **true percentile** for the paper, not their uncertainty about what\nanother evaluator might say. If evaluators are well-calibrated and the\n\"true percentile\" exists, we'd still expect substantial disagreement\nbecause evaluators have access to different information and expertise.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-credible-intervals .cell tbl-cap='Credible interval overlap: Proportions of midpoints within other evaluators\\' 90% credible intervals (49 papers, 95 evaluations)'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# This gives a dataset with one row per paper per dimension, and all\n# ratings and CIs of all evaluators in a single row.\nratings_dims <- ratings |>\n  mutate(.by = research,\n    # This simply numbers the evaluators 1, 2, ... for each piece of research:\n    eval_num  = as.numeric(factor(evaluator)),\n    evaluator = NULL\n  ) |>\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = c(research, criteria), names_from = eval_num,\n                     values_from = c(middle_rating, lower_CI, upper_CI,\n                                    confidence_level))\n\n# This assumes we have no more than 3 evaluators per paper.\nratings_coverage <- ratings_dims |>\n  mutate(\n    mp1ci2 = between(middle_rating_1, lower_CI_2, upper_CI_2),\n    mp1ci3 = between(middle_rating_1, lower_CI_3, upper_CI_3),\n    mp2ci1 = between(middle_rating_2, lower_CI_1, upper_CI_1),\n    mp2ci3 = between(middle_rating_2, lower_CI_3, upper_CI_3),\n    mp3ci1 = between(middle_rating_3, lower_CI_1, upper_CI_1),\n    mp3ci2 = between(middle_rating_3, lower_CI_2, upper_CI_2)\n  ) |>\n  summarize(.by = criteria,\n    `Proportion within C.I.` = mean(c_across(matches(\"mp.ci\")), na.rm = TRUE),\n    `N comparisons` = sum(!is.na(c_across(matches(\"mp.ci\"))))\n  )\n\n# Reorder to match our table ordering\nratings_coverage <- ratings_coverage |>\n  mutate(\n    order_priority = case_when(\n      criteria == \"overall\" ~ 1,\n      criteria == \"merits_journal\" ~ 2,\n      criteria == \"journal_predict\" ~ 3,\n      TRUE ~ 4\n    )\n  ) |>\n  left_join(\n    alpha_df |> select(Dimension, Interval) |> rename(criteria = Dimension, alpha_for_order = Interval),\n    by = \"criteria\"\n  ) |>\n  arrange(order_priority, desc(alpha_for_order)) |>\n  select(-order_priority, -alpha_for_order)\n\nratings_coverage |>\n  rename(Dimension = criteria) |>\n  as_huxtable() |>\n  set_number_format(-1, 2, fmt_percent()) |>\n  set_bold(1, everywhere, TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"huxtable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

It's important to interpret this finding carefully\nin light of our guidelines.\n\nEvaluators are asked to estimate the **true underlying percentile** for\neach paper, not to predict what other evaluators will say. Given that:\n\n1. Different evaluators have different expertise and perspectives\n2. Some papers may genuinely be at different percentiles for different subfields\n3. The \"true percentile\" is itself a somewhat fuzzy concept\n\n...we should expect some degree of between-evaluator disagreement even\nwith perfect calibration. The observed overlap rates of 40-60% suggest\nthat evaluators' intervals do capture meaningful uncertainty, though\nthey may still be somewhat narrower than ideal for capturing all\nreasonable expert opinion.\n\nThis pattern is fairly consistent across dimensions, though there is\nsome variation. The relationship between Krippendorff's alpha (measuring\nbetween-evaluator agreement) and interval overlap provides useful\ninformation about both the consistency of our measures and the\nappropriate level of uncertainty to express.\n\n### Analysis by research area\n\nLet's examine how agreement varies across different cause areas and research categories:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get research areas from the research data\nratings_with_area <- ratings |>\n  left_join(\n    research |> select(label_paper_title, main_cause_cat_abbrev),\n    by = c(\"research\" = \"label_paper_title\")\n  )\n\n# Calculate summary statistics by area for key dimensions\narea_summaries <- ratings_with_area |>\n  filter(criteria %in% c(\"overall\", \"merits_journal\")) |>\n  filter(!is.na(main_cause_cat_abbrev)) |>\n  summarize(.by = c(main_cause_cat_abbrev, criteria),\n    Mean = mean(middle_rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n    SD = sd(middle_rating, na.rm = TRUE),\n    N_ratings = sum(!is.na(middle_rating))\n  ) |>\n  filter(N_ratings >= 5) # Only show areas with at least 5 ratings\n\n# Calculate Krippendorff's alpha by area for \"overall\"\narea_alphas <- list()\nareas_with_data <- unique(ratings_with_area$main_cause_cat_abbrev)\nareas_with_data <- areas_with_data[!is.na(areas_with_data)]\n\nfor (area in areas_with_data) {\n  r_wide <- ratings_with_area |>\n    filter(criteria == \"overall\", main_cause_cat_abbrev == area) |>\n    select(research, evaluator, middle_rating) |>\n    filter(! is.na(middle_rating)) |>\n    mutate(.by = research,\n      eval_num = paste0(\"eval_\", seq_len(n()))\n    ) |>\n    tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = research, names_from = eval_num,\n                       values_from = middle_rating) |>\n    select(-research)\n\n  if (ncol(r_wide) >= 2 && nrow(r_wide) >= 3) {\n    r_matrix <- as.matrix(r_wide)\n    r_matrix <- t(r_matrix)\n    tryCatch({\n      area_alphas[[area]] <- irr::kripp.alpha(r_matrix, method = \"interval\")\n    }, error = function(e) {\n      area_alphas[[area]] <- list(value = NA, subjects = nrow(r_wide))\n    })\n  }\n}\n\narea_alpha_df <- data.frame(\n  Area = names(area_alphas),\n  Alpha = sapply(area_alphas, function(x) x$value),\n  N_papers = sapply(area_alphas, function(x) x$subjects)\n) |>\n  arrange(desc(Alpha))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-area-summary .cell tbl-cap='Mean ratings and variability by research area (areas with 5+ ratings)'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narea_summaries |>\n  mutate(\n    criteria = ifelse(criteria == \"overall\", \"Overall\", \"Should be published\")\n  ) |>\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(\n    id_cols = main_cause_cat_abbrev,\n    names_from = criteria,\n    values_from = c(Mean, SD, N_ratings)\n  ) |>\n  rename(Area = main_cause_cat_abbrev) |>\n  as_huxtable() |>\n  set_number_format(everywhere, -1, \"%.2f\") |>\n  set_bold(1, everywhere, TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"huxtable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border: 0px; margin-bottom: 2em; margin-top: 2em; ; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  \" id=\"tab:tbl-area-summary\">\n<col><col><col><col><col><col><col><tr>\n<th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">Area</th><th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: right; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">Mean_Overall</th><th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: right; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">Mean_Should be published</th><th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: right; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">SD_Overall</th><th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: right; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">SD_Should be published</th><th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: right; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">N_ratings_Overall</th><th style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: right; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: bold;\">N_ratings_Should be published</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left; white-space: normal; border-style: solid solid solid solid; border-width: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0pt;    padding: 6pt 6pt 6pt 6pt; font-weight: normal;\">Dev. econ/gov.

Some areas show higher average ratings, while others\nshow more or less evaluator agreement. Sample sizes vary considerably, so\nthese estimates should be interpreted cautiously for areas with few papers.\n\n## Relatedness and dimensionality\n\nWe have 7 questions measuring paper quality, and 2 questions about\njournal tier. A natural question is: how related are these different\nmeasures? Are they all capturing a single underlying dimension of\n\"quality,\" or do they measure distinct aspects of research?\n\nWe can explore this using principal components analysis (PCA) of the 7\nquality dimensions. PCA finds linear combinations of the original\nvariables that capture the maximum possible variance in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean_ratings <- ratings |>\n  summarize(.by = c(research, criteria),\n    mean_rating = mean(middle_rating, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nmean_ratings_wide <- mean_ratings |>\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(id_cols = research, names_from = criteria,\n                     values_from = mean_rating)\n\n# PCA on quality dimensions only\npc_qual <- princomp(na.omit(mean_ratings_wide[qual_dimensions]))\n\n# Calculate variance explained\nvar_explained_qual <- pc_qual$sdev^2 / sum(pc_qual$sdev^2)\ncumvar_qual <- cumsum(var_explained_qual)\n\n# PCA on all dimensions\npc_all <- princomp(na.omit(mean_ratings_wide[all_dimensions]))\nvar_explained_all <- pc_all$sdev^2 / sum(pc_all$sdev^2)\ncumvar_all <- cumsum(var_explained_all)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Variance explained by principal components\n\nFirst, let's look at how much of the total variation in ratings is\nexplained by each principal component:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvar_df <- data.frame(\n  Component = paste0(\"PC\", 1:length(var_explained_qual)),\n  Variance = var_explained_qual * 100,\n  Cumulative = cumvar_qual * 100\n)\n\nvar_df$Component <- factor(var_df$Component, levels = var_df$Component)\n\nggplot(var_df, aes(x = Component)) +\n  geom_col(aes(y = Variance), fill = \"steelblue\", alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = Cumulative, group = 1), color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = Cumulative), color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Variance explained by principal components\",\n    y = \"Percentage of variance\",\n    x = \"Principal component\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Variance explained by each principal component (quality dimensions only)](index_files/figure-html/fig-scree-1.png){#fig-scree width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe first principal component (PC1) explains\n57.3% of the total variance in the\n7 quality dimensions. The first two components together explain\n77% of the variance, and the first\nthree explain 90.7%.\n\nThis pattern suggests that while there is a dominant \"general quality\"\ndimension, there are also meaningful secondary dimensions capturing\ndistinct aspects of research quality. The fact that PC1 doesn't explain\neverything indicates that our seven questions are not simply redundant\nmeasures of the same thing.\n\n### Component loadings and interpretation\n\nThe table below shows the loadings for the first three components.\nLoadings indicate how much each original variable contributes to each\ncomponent. Larger absolute values mean stronger contributions.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-loadings .cell tbl-cap='Loadings of first 3 principal components on quality ratings'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nldg_qual <- loadings(pc_qual)\nldg_qual <- unclass(ldg_qual)\n\nas_hux(ldg_qual[, 1:3], add_colnames = TRUE, add_rownames = \"Question\") |>\n  style_header_rows(bold = TRUE) |>\n  set_align(-1, -1, \".\") |>\n  set_number_format(-1, -1, \"%.3f\") |>\n  map_text_color(-1, -1, by_colorspace(\"blue\", \"grey\", \"red\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"huxtable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

This appears to be a **general quality factor** -- papers\nthat score high on PC1 score high on essentially all quality dimensions.\n\n**Component 2** shows an interesting contrast: it has strong positive\nloadings on \"open_sci\" and \"real_world\", but near-zero or negative\nloadings on other dimensions. This suggests PC2 captures a dimension\nof **openness and practical relevance** that is somewhat independent of\nthe core methodological and theoretical quality captured by PC1.\n\n**Component 3** shows yet another pattern, with \"gp_relevance\" (relevance\nto global priorities) having a distinctive loading pattern. This suggests\nthat **relevance to global priorities** is somewhat orthogonal to both\ngeneral quality and open/practical dimensions.\n\nThese results indicate that our seven quality dimensions are *not* simply\nredundant measures of a single underlying \"quality\" construct.\n\n### Criteria redundancy: Within-rater correlations\n\nTo further examine whether our criteria are redundant, we can look at\ncorrelations **within individual evaluators**. If two criteria are highly\ncorrelated within raters, it suggests evaluators can't or don't distinguish\nbetween them, and one might be redundant.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate within-rater correlations\nrater_cors_pearson <- list()\nrater_cors_spearman <- list()\n\nfor (eval in unique(ratings$evaluator)) {\n  eval_ratings <- ratings |>\n    filter(evaluator == eval, criteria %in% qual_dimensions) |>\n    select(research, criteria, middle_rating) |>\n    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = criteria, values_from = middle_rating)\n\n  if (nrow(eval_ratings) >= 3) {  # Need at least 3 papers\n    eval_matrix <- as.matrix(eval_ratings[, qual_dimensions])\n\n    # Only calculate if we have variance in the data\n    if (ncol(eval_matrix) >= 2 && any(!is.na(eval_matrix))) {\n      tryCatch({\n        rater_cors_pearson[[eval]] <- cor(eval_matrix, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\")\n        rater_cors_spearman[[eval]] <- cor(eval_matrix, use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\", method = \"spearman\")\n      }, error = function(e) {\n        # Skip this rater if correlation calculation fails\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n# Average correlations across raters\nif (length(rater_cors_pearson) > 0) {\n  mean_cor_pearson <- Reduce(\"+\", rater_cors_pearson) / length(rater_cors_pearson)\n  mean_cor_spearman <- Reduce(\"+\", rater_cors_spearman) / length(rater_cors_spearman)\n\n  # Set diagonal to NA for clearer visualization\n  diag(mean_cor_pearson) <- NA\n  diag(mean_cor_spearman) <- NA\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (length(rater_cors_pearson) > 0) {\n  par(mfrow = c(1, 2))\n\n  corrplot(mean_cor_pearson, method = \"color\", type = \"upper\",\n           tl.col = \"black\", tl.srt = 45,\n           title = \"Pearson correlations\\n(within-rater averages)\",\n           mar = c(0,0,2,0), na.label = \" \")\n\n  corrplot(mean_cor_spearman, method = \"color\", type = \"upper\",\n           tl.col = \"black\", tl.srt = 45,\n           title = \"Spearman correlations\\n(within-rater averages)\",\n           mar = c(0,0,2,0), na.label = \" \")\n\n  par(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Average within-rater correlations between quality dimensions](index_files/figure-html/fig-within-rater-cors-1.png){#fig-within-rater-cors width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-highest-cors .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 criterion pairs by within-rater Pearson correlation'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (length(rater_cors_pearson) > 0) {\n  # Extract highest correlations\n  cor_pairs <- data.frame(\n    Criterion1 = rep(qual_dimensions, each = length(qual_dimensions)),\n    Criterion2 = rep(qual_dimensions, length(qual_dimensions)),\n    Pearson = as.vector(mean_cor_pearson),\n    Spearman = as.vector(mean_cor_spearman)\n  ) |>\n    filter(Criterion1 < Criterion2) |>  # Remove duplicates\n    arrange(desc(Pearson)) |>\n    head(10)\n\n  cor_pairs |>\n    as_huxtable() |>\n    set_number_format(everywhere, 3:4, \"%.3f\") |>\n    set_bold(1, everywhere, TRUE)\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"huxtable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Typically, \"overall\"\nassessment and \"adv_knowledge\" show the strongest correlations with\nboth merit and prediction ratings.\n\n\"open_sci\" tends to show weaker correlations with journal\ntier predictions, which may reflect a realistic assessment that\ntraditional journals don't always reward open science practices as\nstrongly as other quality dimensions.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis analysis of 49 papers and 95 evaluations\nreveals several key patterns:\n\n1.  **Data quality**: Most evaluators provide thoughtful, differentiated\n    ratings with few signs of straightlining or obviously problematic\n    confidence intervals.\n\n2.  **Inter-rater reliability**: We see moderate agreement between\n    evaluators (Krippendorff's interval alpha typically 0.4-0.6),\n    suggesting our measures capture real but subjective aspects of quality.\n    Credible interval overlap analysis suggests evaluators' intervals\n    capture meaningful uncertainty about true underlying quality.\n\n3.  **Dimensionality**: The seven quality dimensions are not redundant.\n    While there is a strong general quality factor (explaining\n    ~57% of variance), we also see\n    meaningful secondary dimensions related to open science/practical\n    relevance and global priorities relevance. Within-rater correlation\n    analysis confirms that evaluators distinguish meaningfully between\n    our different criteria.\n\n4.  **Journal tiers**: Evaluators consistently judge papers as meriting\n    higher-tier publication than they predict they will receive.\n    This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001) with a\n    small to medium\n    effect size. As we observe actual publication outcomes, we'll be able to\n    assess the accuracy of these predictions.\n\nAs our dataset continues to grow, we will be able to conduct more\nsophisticated analyses, track changes over time, and eventually validate\nour predictions against actual publication outcomes.\n",
