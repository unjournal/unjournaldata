Our evaluators don't just assess research; they provide detailed, quantitative ratings across multiple dimensions, from methodological rigor to real-world relevance.\n\nThis post analyzes the **45 papers with full evaluations** completed by The Unjournal in 2024-2025, identifying exceptional research based on:\n\n- **High merited journal tier ratings** (4+ on 1-5 scale, where 5 = top-tier journal quality)\n- **Careful, detailed evaluations** reflecting genuine assessment\n- **Confidence-adjusted scores** (narrow confidence intervals = more certain judgments)\n- **\"Diamond in the rough\" potential** (merited journal tier > predicted journal tier)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## About This Analysis\n\nThis analysis was prepared with substantial assistance from **Claude Code** (Anthropic's AI assistant). While Claude helped identify patterns, extract data, and draft content, all claims should be verified against the [original evaluation summaries](https://unjournal.pubpub.org) linked throughout.\n\n**Important caveats to keep in mind:**\n\n- **Aggregate scores combine multiple dimensions**; individual ratings may tell different stories\n- **Papers with single evaluators** have higher uncertainty than multi-evaluator papers (marked with * in rankings)\n- **High evaluator disagreement** (marked with † in rankings) indicates genuine methodological debate, not paper quality issues\n- **Author engagement status** reflects response to *this* evaluation process, not general scholarly openness\n- The Unjournal's value lies not just in ratings, but in the **substantive dialogue** between evaluators and authors\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## The 2024-2025 Cohort: Overview\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Papers evaluated:**  45 \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Mean merited journal tier score:**  3.84 /5.0\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Mean overall rating:**  75.5 /100\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Papers scoring 4.5+ on merited journal tier:**  8 \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Papers with diamond scores ≥0.5:**  7 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Quality Distribution\n\n![Quality scatter plot showing merited journal tier vs. overall scores for all 45 papers evaluated in 2024-2025. Point size indicates number of evaluators; color indicates aggregate quality score.](visualizations/quality_scatter.png){width=100%}\n\nThe 2024-2025 cohort reflects The Unjournal's global priorities focus: environmental and health research dominate, with substantial representation across development economics, democratic governance, and philosophy/ethics (see topic chart below).\n\n## Exemplary Scholarly Dialogue\n\n**The Unjournal's value lies not just in ratings, but in the substantive exchange between evaluators and authors.** The following papers demonstrate this dialogue at its best—cases where authors engaged deeply with evaluator critiques, leading to improved understanding even when final ratings varied widely.\n\n### [Water Treatment and Child Mortality](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumwatertreatment)\n\n**Ratings:** 50/100 vs. 85/100 (35-point evaluator disagreement) | **Response:** 10,246 words\n\nThis paper exemplifies productive scholarly tension. The first evaluation team (Sharma Waddington & Masset) gave detailed methodological critiques—questioning study inclusion transparency, undisclosed deviations from pre-registration, and policy implications—resulting in a 50/100 rating. The second evaluator found \"no major technical issues\" and rated it 85/100.\n\nRather than simply defend their work, the authors updated the working paper in response. The evaluation manager notes:\n\n> \"The evaluators noted a number of ways that the paper could be improved, it in turn was improved, and while the headline result remains largely the same, we have now learned some new things about the stability of the results... I extend my sincere thanks to the evaluators and the authors for what I view as a fulfilling and transparent cooperative effort to reach the best possible answer to an important question.\"\n\n**What this shows:** High evaluator disagreement doesn't indicate paper quality problems—it reflects genuine methodological debate. The 35-point split here represents different standards: rigorous meta-analysis methodology (E1) versus practical utility and cost-effectiveness contribution (E2).\n\n---\n\n### [The Effect of Public Science on Corporate R&D](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumpublicscience)\n\n**Ratings:** 64/100 vs. 75/100 | **Response:** 6,509 words\n\nThis evaluation produced what the manager called \"a particularly rich public discussion of econometric identification issues.\" Evaluator 1 raised fundamental concerns about the identification strategy, citing \"bad controls and a shift-share design with endogenous shares.\" Evaluator 2 (Bournakis) found the results \"convincing\" while suggesting robustness checks.\n\nThe authors (Arora et al.) responded with a sophisticated 6,500-word defense, directly engaging with advanced econometric theory—explaining why lagged, predetermined shares mitigate endogeneity concerns and why shift-share designs don't require share exogeneity if shifts are exogenous.\n\n**What this shows:** Even when evaluators fundamentally disagree about methodology, the resulting public exchange creates lasting scholarly value—a resource for anyone working on similar identification problems.\n\n---\n\n### [StrongMinds Cost-Effectiveness](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumstrongminds)\n\n**Ratings:** 85/100 vs. 87/100 (aligned scores) | **Response:** 7,485 words\n\nUnlike the papers above, these evaluators gave nearly identical overall scores. Yet their qualitative discussions reveal substantive disagreement masked by aligned numbers. Evaluator 1 praised the work's rigor while flagging \"ad hoc adjustments.\" Evaluator 2 went further, calling many decisions \"arbitrary and subjective\" and recommending a \"multiverse approach.\"\n\nThe Happier Lives Institute authors responded in detail, defending their choices as \"principled decisions with empirical bases rather than pure subjective guesses\"—while also clarifying why systematic CEAs require judgment calls where academic consensus doesn't exist.\n\n**What this shows:** Similar ratings can mask different concerns. Reading only the numbers (85/87) misses the substantive methodological debate about how to handle unavoidable uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\n---\n\n### [Resilient Foods for Global Catastrophes](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/responseallfed)\n\n**Response:** 3,192 words | **Evaluation:** 3 evaluators\n\nThis paper's authors demonstrated intellectual humility in their response. Rather than defending every position, they:\n\n> \"Commend the format and reviewer comments which were of extremely high quality... We value good epistemics and understand that it takes many people critically looking at a problem to achieve this, which is what motivated our participation in the Unjournal pilot.\"\n\nThey acknowledged that their comparison with AGI safety needed clarification, accepted criticism about lack of sensitivity analysis for discount rates, and agreed their cost estimates were \"likely low.\"\n\n**What this shows:** Substantive engagement doesn't require defending every choice. Acknowledging limitations and suggesting future work can be as valuable as robust defense.\n\n---\n\n## Top Papers: Detailed Profiles\n\n### Climate & Environmental Research\n\n#### **#1: [A Welfare Analysis of Policies Impacting Climate Change](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumwelfareclimatechange)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.84** (Highest in 2024-2025) | **Merited journal tier: 4.45/5.0** | **Overall: 90.5/100**\n\nThis paper applies the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF) framework to 96 US environmental policies, providing rigorous welfare rankings beyond simple cost-per-ton metrics.\n\n**Evaluator 1 (Johannes Emmerling):**\n\n> \"This is an excellent paper that makes significant contributions to climate policy evaluation. The authors' application of the MVPF framework to analyze 96 US environmental policies provides valuable insights that traditional cost-per-ton metrics often miss.\"\n\n**Evaluator 2 (Frank Venmans):**\n\n> \"Under which policy does a dollar of subsidy create the largest impact on welfare? The paper answers these questions by developing the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF). This allows [one] to rank government policies according to their welfare impacts while respecting a given government budget.\"\n\n**Author engagement:** The authors declined to respond to evaluations but noted they may wish to do so at a later date.\n\n**DOI:** [doi.org/10.3386/w32728](https://doi.org/10.3386/w32728)\n\n---\n\n#### **#2: [Urban Forests: Environmental Health Values and Risks](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumurbanforests)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.76** | **Merited journal tier: 4.35/5.0** | **Overall: 75/100**\n\nThis paper examines urban forests' environmental health benefits and risks, combining ecological and economic analysis.\n\n**Author engagement:** The authors granted permission to evaluate this paper and were very responsive and encouraging throughout the process. They opted not to provide a formal response to the evaluations but remain open to future engagement.\n\n---\n\n#### **#3: [The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsummacroclimatechange)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.76** | **Merited journal tier: 4.6/5.0** | **Overall: 87.5/100**\n\nEstimates macroeconomic damages from climate change at **6x larger than previous estimates** (12% vs. 2% GDP reduction per degree warming).\n\n**Evaluation highlight:**\n\n> \"Overall, the manuscript is well written in the sense that, since the reader understands immediately what is being estimated and why, they could be lulled into the trap of thinking that the research is 'obvious.' But it is the careful empirical construction of the argument, and the identification that a literature has been mechanically missing (netting out) the effect of global warming, that makes this research important.\"\n\n> \"The manuscript contains numerous robustness tests, including [some...] involving much work (such as re-estimation with a temperature measure independently created than the primary one), and clear explanations about why each was implemented.\"\n\n**Author engagement:** The authors were offered the opportunity to respond to these evaluations but declined.\n\n**DOI:** [doi.org/10.3386/w32450](https://doi.org/10.3386/w32450)\n\n---\n\n### Democratic Governance & Political Economy\n\n#### **#4: [Misperceptions and Demand for Democracy under Authoritarianism](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumdemandfordemocracy)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.74** | **Merited journal tier: 4.2/5.0** | **Overall: 86.5/100** | **Hours: 16**\n\nField experiment in Turkey showing information interventions increased opposition vote share by 0.8 percentage points (1.5% relative increase).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n> \"This paper makes a valuable contribution to research on authoritarianism and democratic resilience by combining an online survey and a large-scale field experiment in Turkey... The study is theoretically ambitious, well-powered, and methodologically transparent, with the field experiment demonstrating real-world behavioral effects on opposition vote share.\"\n\n> \"I am inclined to believe this claim as the field experiment is well-powered, pre-registered, and analyzed using appropriate instrumental variable (2SLS) methods, which lends credibility to the causal inference.\"\n\n**Author engagement:** The authors were aware of the evaluation and kept evaluators updated on the most recent versions of their work. They were unable to commit to a formal response timeline.\n\n**DOI:** [10.3386/w33018](https://doi.org/10.3386/w33018)\n\n---\n\n#### **#5: [Does the Squeaky Wheel Get More Grease?](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/jq95bapl)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.73** | **Merited journal tier: 4.55/5.0** | **Overall: 85/100**\n\nPublished in American Economic Review. Innovative RCT on citizen reporting of pollution violations in China, capturing both direct and spillover effects.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n> \"This is clearly a very neat experimental design. All prefectures contain some treated firms, but the intensity of treatment (70% or 95% of firms assigned to treatment) varies so that they can assess the 'general equilibrium' effect.\"\n\n**DOI:** [10.1257/aer.20221215](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20221215)\n\n---\n\n### Behavioral Interventions & Development\n\n#### **#6: [Selecting the Most Effective Nudge](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumeffectivenudge)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.73** | **Merited journal tier: 4.6/5.0** | **Overall: 90/100**\n\nLarge-scale experiment on immunization nudges, identifying most effective behavioral interventions.\n\n**Author engagement:** The authors acknowledged the evaluations and declined to respond formally, noting that the paper had been accepted for publication in Econometrica.\n\n---\n\n#### **#7: The Long-Run Effects of Psychotherapy**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.71** | **Merited journal tier: 4.35/5.0** | **Overall: 84/100**\n\nTracks long-term impacts of psychotherapy on depression, beliefs, and economic outcomes.\n\n---\n\n#### **#8: [Does Conservation Work in General Equilibrium?](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumconservationequilibrium)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.70** | **Merited journal tier: 4.0/5.0** | **Overall: 70/100**\n\nExamines whether conservation interventions work when accounting for general equilibrium effects.\n\n**Author engagement:** The authors granted permission for evaluation under The Unjournal's interim policy, appreciated the suggestions, and indicated they are working to address them in their next draft. They have expressed willingness to respond formally in the future.\n\n---\n\n### Cash Transfers & Poverty Reduction\n\n#### **#9: How Effective Is (More) Money?**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.69** | **Merited journal tier: 4.35/5.0** | **Overall: 82/100**\n\nRandomizes unconditional cash transfer amounts in the US to understand marginal impacts.\n\n---\n\n#### **#10: [The wellbeing cost-effectiveness of StrongMinds](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumstrongminds)**\n\n**Aggregate Score: 0.69** | **Merited journal tier: 4.2/5.0** | **Overall: 86/100**\n\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of psychotherapy cost-effectiveness, including charity-specific data from Happier Lives Institute.\n\n**Author engagement:** The Happier Lives Institute authors provided a detailed and careful [written response](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/authorsresponsestrongminds) to the evaluations, engaging substantively with methodological critiques and defending their analytical choices as principled and conservative.\n\n---\n\n## Diamonds in the Rough\n\nPapers where evaluators saw **significantly higher** potential than predicted journal placement (difference ≥0.5 on the 1-5 scale):\n\n![Diamond plot showing merited journal tier vs. predicted journal tier.

Methodological Excellence is Universal\n\nEvery top-rated paper demonstrates:\n\n- **Pre-registration** or transparent research design\n- **Appropriate statistical methods**\n- **Extensive robustness checks**\n- **Clear identification strategies**\n\n### 2. Real-World Relevance Distinguishes Impact\n\nPapers scoring highest provide actionable insights:\n\n- Climate policy rankings (welfare analysis)\n- Election intervention effects (democracy paper)\n- Pollution enforcement strategies (China governance)\n- Cash transfer optimization (multiple papers)\n\n### 3. Long-Term Data Reveals Hidden Effects\n\n- **Deworming** (20-year follow-up): Intergenerational effects\n- **Psychotherapy** (long-run): Persistent belief changes\n- **UBI Kenya**: Multi-year household impacts\n\n### 4. Innovative Designs Get Recognized\n\nEvaluators praised:\n\n- **Macro-climate**: Identifying what literature mechanically missed\n- **China governance**: Spillover effects design\n- **Democracy Turkey**: Administrative ballot data + IV methods\n\n### 5. Evaluation Depth Correlates with Quality\n\nPapers receiving most thorough evaluations (12-16 hours) scored highest, suggesting:\n- Evaluators invest time proportional to quality\n- Detailed assessment identifies genuine strengths\n- Thorough feedback potential for improvement\n\n### 6. Topic Distribution Reflects Global Priorities\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/topic-chart-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe distribution aligns with The Unjournal's focus on high-impact research for global priorities. Environmental and health economics dominate—reflecting urgent climate and public health challenges—while democracy, development, and existential risk research receive substantial attention.\n\n## What The Unjournal Adds\n\nThese evaluations demonstrate The Unjournal's unique value:\n\n**1. Public, Detailed Feedback**\nInstead of anonymous accept/reject decisions, authors and readers see exactly what evaluators think, with evidence and reasoning.\n\n**2. Quantitative Ratings**\nMulti-dimensional scoring reveals strengths and weaknesses more precisely than traditional reviews.\n\n**3. Timely Assessment**\nMany papers evaluated as working papers, providing feedback before traditional journal review.\n\n**4. Focus on Impact**\nCriteria like \"real-world relevance\" and \"global priorities relevance\" ensure practical importance matters.\n\n**5. Transparent Disagreement**\nWhen evaluators disagree, both perspectives are public, enriching discourse.\n\n## Key Statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Papers with merited journal tier ≥ 4.0:** 28 (62%)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Papers with merited journal tier ≥ 4.5:**  8 \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Total evaluations:**  83 \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n**Average evaluations per paper:**  1.8 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe 45 papers evaluated by The Unjournal in 2024-2025 showcase research that matters: rigorous methods applied to consequential questions, from climate policy and democratic governance to poverty reduction and long-term development.\n\nThese papers earned high ratings through:\n\n- **Research design excellence**\n- **Data quality and transparency**\n- **Methodological rigor**\n- **Real-world relevance**\n- **Open science practices**\n\nAs The Unjournal continues expanding coverage, patterns will emerge: Which research areas consistently produce higher-quality work? Does evaluation depth predict research impact? Can we identify \"diamonds in the rough\" earlier?\n\nFor now, these 45 papers represent exceptional research---and they're all publicly accessible, with detailed evaluations available for anyone to read.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [The Unjournal Website](https://www.unjournal.org)\n- [Full Evaluation Database](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/)\n- [Interactive Dashboard](https://unjournal.shinyapps.io/uj-dashboard)\n- [Public Evaluations](https://unjournal.pubpub.org)\n- Analysis code: [analyze_high_quality_papers.py](https://github.com/unjournal/unjournaldata/blob/main/code/analyze_high_quality_papers.py)\n\n---\n\n*Analysis conducted using data current as of December 29, 2025.
