https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e2maternalcashtransfers/draft?access=h605kxny,"Evaluation 2 of ""Maternal cash transfers for gender equity and child development: Experimental evidence from India""",,"5 years after the last transfers (Y3).For household expenditures, treatment is associated with an increase in food expenditure of about 41% of the value of the transfer.For food consumption, they estimate an increase in calorie intake of 18% (Y1) to 14% (Y2) for the target child and 8.5% (Y1) to 16% (Y2) for mothers.For anthropometrics, they observe no impacts on the HAZ, WAZ, probability of stunting, or probability of being underweight for the target child, but curiously observe improvements in WAZ for older siblings of the target child of .11-.13 SD.For child development, the authors find moderate impacts of .12 SD on overall ASQ-3 scores, and .09-.10 SD on the cognitive, gross motor, and fine motor subscales individually.They additionally find small improvements in maternal nutritional knowledge (Y1 and Y2), maternal empowerment (Y1 only), use of selected child health services (Y1 only), and probability of visiting a formal medical provider (Y1 and Y2).The most important contribution of this paper is that it is the first study of the impacts of unconditional cash transfers in India. It features a large sample size relative to other studies of cash transfers and ECD, as well as a comprehensive set of outcomes for household consumption and maternal and child health. The analysis is thorough (as per their pre-analysis plan) and well-writtenMajor CommentsCoherence and framingIt is striking to me that there are substantial gains in child development even in the absence of impacts on anthropometrics or any parenting/other behavioral “plus” components. Previous cash transfer studies that measured ECD outcomes and anthropometrics together had mixed results–typically impacts on neither (Ecuador: Paxson 2010 [2], Niger: Premand 2020 [3], Nepal: Levere 2024 [4]) or both (Mexico: Fernald 2008 [5], Nicaragua: Macours 2012 [6], Tanzania: Sudfeld 2021 [7]), but on occasion only on anthropometrics (Nigeria: Carneiro 2021 [8]). Why do you think your results diverge from previous studies?The Nepal study (Levere 2024 [4]) also observed impacts on anthropometrics for older siblings only. Are there any commonalities between your study and the Nepal study that could explain the replication of this finding?To follow from the introduction and motivation, I suggest a longer discussion of the individual maternal empowerment items and the bank account usage indicators in Table A.1 (i.e., evidence on the empowerment → maternal and child consumption and health expenditure → child development pathway). I would then return to the hypothesis of the “triple dividends” in the conclusion section. What are the policy implications for maternal empowerment and gender equity? Is there any case for policymakers to adopt UCTs over other types of interventions that can enhance intra-household gender equity, in terms of consumption or decision-making power for mothers (e.g. education, job training, behavioral)?In the same vein, I suggest dropping or moving to footnotes the paragraphs on (1) benchmarking against the marginal propensity to consume from in-kind transfers, (2) estimating the income elasticity of food expenditure or calorie consumption, (3) explaining the “puzzle” of falling calorie consumption, etc. since they do not address the question of whether and to what extent cash transfers improve maternal and child well-being specifically (not just recipients in general).UCT in the context of other CCTsThe program in question was implemented alongside existing conditional cash transfer programs JSY (conditional on institutional delivery) and PMMV-Y (conditional on receiving antenatal care and vaccinations). Footnotes 8 and 30 state that the UCT did not affect eligibility for the CCTs, and that the value of the CCTs was too small relative to the value of the UCTs to affect interpretation of results. Although the value of these CCTs was indeed smaller than the value of the UCT, and overall take-up rates of the CCTs are relatively low (12% in the control group and an additional 4% in the treatment group according to Table A.10), the fact that a subset of the UCT participants were simultaneously meeting conditionalities that could affect anthropometrics and ECD outcomes seems worth discussing. What impact do the authors think the JSY and PMMV-Y conditionalities may have had on the effectiveness of the UCT?Furthermore, it is notable that the program in question was situated within a broader system that was already delivering cash transfers and health, nutrition, and ECD services at scale (i.e., a system with an ECD agenda, significant health infrastructure, and high engagement with child health services, including nutrition, as the authors note). How does this compare to the context in other countries that have implemented UCTs targeting early childhood: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ecuador, Madagascar, Nepal, Niger, Uganda? Is this a “high baseline”?The role of sanitationThe authors argue that sanitation is the primary reason that increased calorie intake/nutrition did not result in impacts on growth outcomes for the target child. However, other studies in LMICs have compared joint nutrition and sanitation interventions to only nutrition interventions directly, and effects on stunting, wasting, and underweight are not consistently better (see below for references). Please comment.The authors reconcile the heterogeneity of impacts on the target child by sanitation with the lack of corresponding heterogeneity in impacts on older siblings by “age-based differences in vulnerability to poor sanitation”, i.e. younger children are more susceptible (less immune) to diarrheal disease. Could other factors that are correlated with sanitation and birth order (e.g. changes in dietary composition or food preparation practices, especially when weaning) be responsible for this pattern?Exclusion of breastmilk from child food consumptionIt is not clear to me why the calorie intake and dietary diversity measurements do not include breastmilk as a category–especially at Y1, when 96% of mothers were still breastfeeding, but also at Y2, given that WHO guidelines recommend breastfeeding with complementary food feeding until at least age 2. If the cash increased maternal caloric intake, it could also have increased the number of feeds or the nutritional content of breastmilk, leading to even larger impacts on child caloric intake and dietary diversity. In other words, without including breastmilk, the estimates in Table 2 would represent lower bounds.Things that are missingDiscussion of how measures were selected and if they were adapted or validated for the study population, especially the ASQDiscussion of why certain outcomes only showed up in Y1 or Y2, or changed in magnitude from Y1 to Y2Section on limitationsMinor CommentsLiterature to incorporateWhat is already known about the responsiveness of food expenditure and child dietary intake to cash transfers[9] de Groot, R., Palermo, T., Handa, S., Ragno, L.
