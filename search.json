    "section": "About the data",
    "text": "About the data\nPapers1 can be suggested for evaluation either by Unjournal insiders, or by outsiders. The Unjournal then selects some papers for evaluation. I won’t focus on the details of this process here. Just note that we have more suggested papers than actual evaluations.\nEach paper is typically evaluated by two evaluators, though some have more or less than two. Getting two or more of every measure is useful, because it will let us check evaluations against each other.\nWe ask evaluators two kinds of quantitative questions. First, there are different measures of paper quality. Here they are, along with some snippets from our guidelines for evaluators:\n\nOverall assessment: “Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production, and importance to practice.”\nAdvancing our knowledge and practice: “To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to practice, particularly in ways that are relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?…”\nMethods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness: “Are the methods used well-justified and explained; are they a reasonable approach to answering the question(s) in this context? Are the underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results and methods likely to be robust to reasonable changes in the underlying assumptions?…”\nLogic and communication: “Are the goals and questions of the paper clearly expressed? Are concepts clearly defined and referenced? Is the reasoning ‘transparent’? Are assumptions made explicit? Are all logical steps clear and correct? Does the writing make the argument easy to follow?”\nOpen, collaborative, replicable science: “This covers several considerations: Replicability, reproducibility, data integrity… Consistency… Useful building blocks: Do the authors provide tools, resources, data, and outputs that might enable or enhance future work and meta-analysis?”\nReal-world relevance: “Are the assumptions and setup realistic and relevant to the real world?”\nRelevance to global priorities: “Could the paper’s topic and approach potentially help inform global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact interventions?\n\nEach of these questions is meant to be a percentile scale, 0-100%, where the percentage captures the paper’s place in the distribution of the reference group (“all serious research in the same area that you have encountered in the last three years”).2 So, for example, a score of 70% would mean the paper is better than 70% of papers in the reference group. But note, the papers we evaluate are not randomly sampled from their reference group, so we should not necessarily expect them to be uniformly distributed on 0-100%.\nAs well as asking for each question (the midpoint or median of the evaluator’s belief distribution), we also ask for lower and upper bounds of a 90% credible interval.\nNext, we ask two practical questions about publication:\n\n“What journal ranking tier should this work be published in?”\n“What journal ranking tier will this work be published in?”\n\nTiers are measured from 0 (“won’t publish/little to no value”) up to 5 (“top journal”). Again, we ask for both an estimate and a 90% credible interval. We allow non-integer scores between 0 and 5.\nThe last question is especially interesting, because unlike all the others, it has an observable ground truth. Eventually, papers do or do not get published in specific journals, and there is often a consensus about which journals count as e.g. “top”."

Or do some of them treat them as a nuisance compared to the “real”, written review?\nBoth these questions can be partly addressed by running sanity checks. For example, do people “straightline” questions, giving the same answer for every question? Do they produce excessively narrow or wide confidence intervals?\nAre our quantitative measures accurate? Do they capture something “real” about the paper? Obviously, we don’t have access to “ground truth” – except in one case.\nAre the different measures related? Is there a single underlying dimension beneath the different numbers? Or more than one dimension?\nHow do quantitative measures relate to the written, qualitative evaluation? Does a more positive written evaluation also score higher on the numbers? Can you predict the numbers from the evaluation?\nDo evaluators understand the questions in the same way? Are different evaluators of the same paper answering the “same questions” in their head? What about evaluators of different papers in different fields?\nDo papers score differently in different fields? This could be because evaluators hold papers to different standards in those fields – or because some fields do genuinely better on some dimensions. We could ask the same question about different methodologies: for example, do randomized controlled trials score differently than other approaches?\n\n\n\nWarning: Duplicate rows found in ratings data."

    "text": "Accuracy\nWe have no ground truth of whether a given paper scores high or low on our 7 dimensions. But because we usually have multiple evaluations per paper, we can take an indirect route. If two evaluators’ scores are correlated with reality, they will also correlate with each other. The converse does not necessarily hold: evaluators’ scores might be correlated because they both have similar prejudices or both misinterpret the paper in the same way. All the same, high “inter-rater reliability” (IRR) should increase our confidence that our scores are measuring something.\nIRR is complex. The basic form of most IRR statistics is\n\\[\n\\frac{p_a - p_e}{1 - p_e}\n\\]\nwhere \\(p_a\\) is the proportion of the time that two raters agree, and \\(p_e\\) is the amount of agreement you’d expect by chance if both raters are choosing independently.\nWhy not use \\(p_a\\) directly? Well, for example, suppose our raters pick an expected journal tier at random, from 0 to 5 inclusive. Clearly there’s no reliability: the data is just random noise. But one time in six, both raters will agree, simply by chance. So we need to adjust for the expected amount of agreement. To do this most measures use the marginal distributions of the ratings: in our example, a 1 in 6 chance of each number from 0 to 5, giving \\(p_e = 1/6\\). Krippendorff’s alpha is a widely accepted statistic that corrects for \\(p_e\\) and also defines “agreement” appropriately for different levels of measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a reliability statistic\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to measure inter-rater reliability. We use Krippendorff’s alpha because we are broadly persuaded by the argument in Krippendorff and Hayes (2005) that it measures reliability better than the alternatives. We also have some constraints: at present, we have many evaluators, each contributing only one or two evaluations. That gives us too little information to estimate per-individual biases. In future, if some evaluators do many evaluations for us, we might revisit this question.\nWe use the alpha statistic for a ratio scale, because our ratings are meant to be quantiles, which have a natural scale and zero. And we only use papers with exactly two evaluations. There is a single paper with three evaluations; adding this in would give us many missing values in the “third evaluation” column, and we’d have to use more advanced techniques to deal with these.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Krippendorf's alpha statistics for our quantitative measures.

Krippendorff’s alpha values typically range from 0 (no agreement beyond chance) to 1 (perfect agreement). Values above 0.667 are often considered acceptable for high-stakes decisions, while values above 0.8 indicate strong reliability.\nOur values suggest moderate agreement across dimensions. The quality dimensions (overall assessment, methods, etc.) generally show reliability in the 0.4-0.6 range, which is typical for subjective expert judgments. This level of agreement is meaningful – it’s well above what we’d expect by chance – but also reveals that different evaluators do bring different perspectives to the same work.\nThe journal tier predictions show varying levels of agreement. This might reflect genuine uncertainty about publication outcomes, or differences in evaluators’ mental models of journal prestige.\n\nCredible interval overlap\nBecause we have each rater’s 90% credible interval, we can also ask a slightly different question: do raters tend to agree that each other’s estimates are “reasonable”?

This suggests that our evaluators may be systematically overconfident in their assessments.\nIf evaluators were appropriately calibrated, we would expect roughly 90% of midpoint estimates to fall within the stated 90% credible intervals. The observed rates of 40-60% indicate that evaluators are stating narrower intervals than the actual variation in their assessments warrants. Put differently, evaluators’ credible intervals are capturing their own uncertainty reasonably well, but they’re underestimating how much other evaluators might reasonably disagree with them.\nThis overconfidence pattern is fairly consistent across dimensions, though there is some variation. Understanding the sources of this overconfidence – whether it reflects genuine differences in interpretation, different standards, or psychological biases – is an important avenue for future research. It may also have practical implications: if we want evaluators’ credible intervals to reflect true uncertainty about a paper’s “true” quality, we may need to encourage wider intervals or provide calibration training."

    "text": "Relatedness and dimensionality\nWe have 7 questions measuring paper quality, and 2 questions about journal tier. A natural question is: how related are these different measures? Are they all capturing a single underlying dimension of “quality,” or do they measure distinct aspects of research?\nWe can explore this using principal components analysis (PCA) of the 7 quality dimensions. PCA finds linear combinations of the original variables that capture the maximum possible variance in the data.\n\n\n\n\nVariance explained by principal components\nFirst, let’s look at how much of the total variation in ratings is explained by each principal component:\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Variance explained by each principal component (quality dimensions only)\n\n\n\n\nThe first principal component (PC1) explains {r} round(var_explained_qual[1] * 100, 1)% of the total variance in the 7 quality dimensions. The first two components together explain {r} round(cumvar_qual[2] * 100, 1)% of the variance, and the first three explain {r} round(cumvar_qual[3] * 100, 1)%.\nThis pattern suggests that while there is a dominant “general quality” dimension, there are also meaningful secondary dimensions capturing distinct aspects of research quality. The fact that PC1 doesn’t explain everything (it typically accounts for 60-70% of variance in similar studies) indicates that our seven questions are not simply redundant measures of the same thing.\n\n\nComponent loadings and interpretation\nTable 3 shows the loadings for the first three components. Loadings indicate how much each original variable contributes to each component. Larger absolute values mean stronger contributions.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Loadings of first 3 principal components on quality ratings \n\nQuestionComp.1Comp.2Comp.3\n\noverall0.3560.2870.241\n\nadv_knowledge0.486−0.1040.217\n\nmethods0.4280.5070.310\n\nlogic_comms0.2470.334−0.269\n\nreal_world0.480−0.338−0.357\n\ngp_relevance0.402−0.452−0.243\n\nopen_sci−0.0150.468−0.735\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent 1 has uniformly positive loadings across all dimensions, with the strongest weights on “overall”, “adv_knowledge”, “methods”, and “logic_comms”. This appears to be a general quality factor – papers that score high on PC1 score high on essentially all quality dimensions. This makes sense: better papers tend to be better on most dimensions.\nComponent 2 shows an interesting contrast: it has strong positive loadings on “open_sci” and “real_world”, but near-zero or negative loadings on other dimensions. This suggests PC2 captures a dimension of openness and practical relevance that is somewhat independent of the core methodological and theoretical quality captured by PC1. Papers can score high on methodological sophistication without necessarily being strong on open science practices, and vice versa. This might reflect a tradeoff in practice (limited time/resources) or a genuine distinction between “academically rigorous” and “practically useful” work.\nComponent 3 shows yet another pattern, with “gp_relevance” (relevance to global priorities) having a distinctive loading pattern. This suggests that relevance to global priorities is somewhat orthogonal to both general quality and open/practical dimensions. A paper can be methodologically excellent and practically applicable without being particularly relevant to global priorities questions, or vice versa.\nThese results indicate that our seven quality dimensions are not simply redundant measures of a single underlying “quality” construct. While there is a strong general quality factor, evaluators are also distinguishing between methodological quality, open science practices, and relevance to global priorities in meaningful ways. This validates our decision to ask multiple distinct questions rather than just a single “overall quality” score."

The “merits” question (what tier should the paper be in) has alpha = {r} round(kr_alpha_values[[which(all_dimensions == \"merits_journal\")]], 3), while the “prediction” question (what tier will it be in) has alpha = {r} round(kr_alpha_values[[which(all_dimensions == \"journal_predict\")]], 3).\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of merit vs. prediction ratings for journal tiers\n\n\n\n\nMost points lie above the diagonal line, confirming that evaluators generally believe papers merit higher tier publication than they predict they will receive. This gap might reflect:\n\nPublication bias: Beliefs that novel or unconventional findings face barriers in traditional peer review\nFit issues: The papers we evaluate may not fit neatly into existing journal categories\nRealistic pessimism: Understanding that the publication process involves randomness and gatekeeping beyond pure quality\nStandards differences: Our evaluators may hold papers to different standards than typical journal reviewers\n\nAs our data grows and we observe actual publication outcomes, we’ll be able to test which of these explanations is most accurate.\n\n\nRelationship to quality dimensions\nFinally, we can examine how the journal tier ratings relate to the seven quality dimensions:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlations between quality dimensions and journal tier ratings\n\n\n\n\nThis shows which quality dimensions are most strongly associated with evaluators’ judgments about journal tier. Typically, “overall” assessment and “adv_knowledge” show the strongest correlations with both merit and prediction ratings, suggesting these are the primary drivers of journal tier expectations.\nInterestingly, “open_sci” tends to show weaker correlations with journal tier predictions, which may reflect a realistic assessment that traditional journals don’t always reward open science practices as strongly as other quality dimensions. Similarly, “gp_relevance” may show distinctive patterns reflecting the fact that global priorities relevance isn’t a primary criterion for most academic journals."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nThis analysis of {r} n_papers papers and {r} n_evals evaluations reveals several key patterns:\n\nData quality: Most evaluators provide thoughtful, differentiated ratings with few signs of straightlining or obviously problematic confidence intervals. This gives us confidence in the quality of our quantitative data.\nInter-rater reliability: We see moderate agreement between evaluators (Krippendorff’s alpha typically 0.4-0.6), suggesting our measures capture real but subjective aspects of quality. However, evaluators appear overconfident – their stated 90% credible intervals only contain their co-evaluators’ midpoint estimates about 50% of the time. This suggests a need for calibration training or encouragement to express wider uncertainty ranges.\nDimensionality: The seven quality dimensions are not redundant. While there is a strong general quality factor (explaining ~{r} round(var_explained_qual[1] * 100)% of variance), we also see meaningful secondary dimensions related to open science/practical relevance and global priorities relevance. This validates our multi-dimensional approach to evaluation.\nJournal tiers: Evaluators consistently judge papers as meriting higher-tier publication than they predict they will receive (gap of ~{r} round(journal_summary$Mean[journal_summary$criteria == \"merits_journal\"] - journal_summary$Mean[journal_summary$criteria == \"journal_predict\"], 1) tiers). This might reflect beliefs about barriers in the traditional publication process, or realistic assessments of fit and gatekeeping issues. As we observe actual publication outcomes, we’ll be able to assess the accuracy of these predictions.\n\nAs our dataset continues to grow, we will be able to conduct more sophisticated analyses, track changes over time, and eventually validate our predictions against actual publication outcomes. We’re also interested in exploring variation across research areas and methodologies, and in understanding what drives disagreement between evaluators."
