# unjournaldata

This is the repository for
[Unjournal](https://www.unjournal.org) evaluations, meta-analysis, and meta-science.

Outputs and reports from here are published at <https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata>.


## How it works: data and dashboards

A single GitHub Action:

* Exports data from Coda to csv files in the `/data` folder, via `code/import-unjournal-data.py`.
* Creates the [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co) dashboard at <https://unjournal.shinyapps.io/uj-dashboard>.

This action is automatically run 

* when the "main" branch is pushed to;
* once daily in any case.


## How it works: website and blog posts

The Unjournal data website is in the `/website` folder. It's not
created on GitHub, but directly on developer machines. 

* To add a blog post, create a new folder inside `website/posts`, and an 
  `index.qmd` file inside the folder. 
* Then navigate to the `website` folder and run `quarto publish gh-pages` from 
  the command line. This will update the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub, which 
  will then be reflected on the [unjournal.github.io website](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata).
* Individual blog posts are *frozen*, so they won't be updated once they have been
  created. See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#freezing-posts).
* Also add and push your blog post, so your source code is visible on GitHub.
* See <https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html> and 
  <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html> for more details.


## Data

The files in the `/data` folder are imported from Coda:

* `paper_authors.csv`: Lists of authors per paper.
* `research.csv`: evaluated papers.
* `rsx_evalr_rating.csv`: quantitative ratings given by each evaluator for each
  paper.

There's also some data from other sources:

* `jql70a.csv`: a list of journal quality rankings, maintained by 
  [Prof. Anne-Wil Harzing](https://harzing.com/resources/journal-quality-list)
  and converted to CSV format. We thank Prof. Harzing for creating this valuable
  resource.
* `jql-enriched.csv`: the same data, enriched with h-index and 
  citedness information from [Openalex](https://openalex.org), and
  our own meta-ranking of journals, via `code/calibrate-journal-stats.R`.
