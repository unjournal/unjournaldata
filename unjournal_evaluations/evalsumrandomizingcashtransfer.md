# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

The paper presents and interprets the results of a well-powered one-time
unconditional cash transfer experiment for low-income people in the US.
The cash significantly increased recipient spending, but decreased
survey measures of self-assessed wellbeing relative to control.
Participant attrition limits the strength of the conclusions we can draw
from this high-quality study. Overall, the study modestly shifted my
views against one-time transfers and toward other policy tools for
reducing poverty and inequality in wealthy societies.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

Overall, I find this paper competently executed. I like the inductive
approach to theorizing after the findings, the multiple tests for
mechanism, extensive robustness checks, and the use of transaction-level
data to check what participants used the money for. The paper has
external validity limitations, and can be framed better since the
unconditional cash transfers were given during the Covid pandemic. \[I
suggest\] several further tests to test the main mechanism, and improve
the mediation analysis.

# Evaluation manager's discussion (Robert Kubinec)

As the evaluation manager for \"How Effective Is (More) Money?
Randomizing Unconditional Cash Transfer Amounts in the US\", I first
want to emphasize how remarkable this piece of research is. The authors
used enormous treatment sizes by the standards of the field (transfers
up to \$2,000) and a vast array of measurements on their subjects. As a
result, they can investigate and rule out a number of mechanisms. In
these situations, we might wish as political economists that the results
conform to our theoretical priors. In this case, they do not--which is
not uncommon with experiments. The growing prominence of field
experiments has shown that we are often over-confident in our ability to
predict the results of policies based on political economy theories. My
hope is that this paper receives the attention it deserves so that we
can make better theories that design better interventions.

However, before I turn to the evaluations, I wanted to provide my own
bottom-line assessment from reading the paper and our evaluations of it.
Cash transfers are one of the development policies du jour, and are
increasingly being tested in developed versus developing countries where
they largely originated. They are also based on a strong grounding in
economic theory, particularly that individuals are best able to optimize
spending given their preferences versus a social planner with limited
information. So does this paper, with its largely negative or null
effects on important outcomes like well-being and health, suggest that
we should abandon this type of policy?

I echo the evaluators\' comments in suggesting that we should not, at
this point, abandon testing these types of policies. Of course, this
conclusion runs the risk of protecting beloved theories from
falsification. If negative results from an RCT do not stop us from
implementing a cash transfer, then what was the point of an RCT? The
reasons why we should not abandon cash transfers, at least at this
stage, is that the RCT -- as robust as it was -- can only answer certain
questions. It answers these questions *very well*, and we need to think
hard about those lessons. But a priori, the RCT did not have a wide
enough scope to show definitely that cash transfers will not affect
important outcomes like health or financial independence.

The RCT\'s limitation in terms of time frame is natural -- studies
cannot be run forever -- but does raise questions. As evaluator 1 noted,
the effects of cash transfers are likely to manifest themselves over the
long-term. As rigorous as this RCT was, they only recorded outcomes at
up to 15 weeks later. The causal chain for cash transfers on outcomes
like well-being or health could be much longer, potentially over years
as lifestyles and habits adjust. For example, an increase in income
could make it easier for a subject to qualify for education or find a
better job--but that is unlikely to occur within 15 weeks. In addition,
as big as this cash incentive was, it is still small relative to
people\'s incomes in a wealthy country like the United States. The
federal poverty level for a single person is about \$15,000, so the
maximum payment offered was about 13% of someone\'s annual income. A
good amount--but not one that was likely to cure all problems a person
might face.

Second, as evaluator 2 noted, there is an issue with so-called external
validity. This RCT was an "opt-in" program where people had to apply to
receive the funds, or what is known as the "treatment effect on the
treated." There are lots of reasons why someone would apply for these
funds, and these factors might also predispose them to see fewer
benefits. Outside of the experimental context, such as in a "real-world"
government policy agenda, these cash transfers would presumably be
available to a much broader slice of the population. As the authors of
the paper note (p. 6), people\'s expectations that the payment could
solve a lot of problems -- which could have been heightened by the fact
that they sought it out[^17] -- could also explain the negative effects
on reported well-being. The fact that the outcomes are relatively
short-term further raises the risk that this factor occurred.

It would be difficult, of course, to run the RCT with a more general
sample, akin to giving lottery payouts to people who did not participate
in the lottery. But, as social scientists, we have to be attuned to
these difficult-to-address contextual factors when interpreting
evidence. At the same time, our theories *should* explain what happened
with this RCT, and at present we do not have perfect answers. The
authors\' work in their paper is commendable and illuminating, but
arguably we need to run more tests with different populations -- along
with analyzing observational data -- to better understand why and how
people reacted the way they did.

My second bottom line is that this RCT *does* provide evidence that cash
transfers are trickier to understand than at first appear. A universal
basic income, for example, might not mitigate as many harms as some
expect. Furthermore, the RCT does demonstrate that subjective well-being
and other important outcomes probably will not change significantly in
the short term following a reasonably-sized payout. That much is clear.

However, we stand to benefit by designing better policy programs if we
pay attention to the RCT\'s wealth of information about their subjects\'
financial activities, perceptions, and even relationships. We also know
that this RCT does not seem to result in significant harm, which is an
important policy consideration -- i.e., the "do no harm criterion".
Given these uncertainties, and the fact that no one appeared to be
harmed by the design (besides a possible short-term increase in
anxiety), there is ample reason to continue testing these types of
policies for poverty alleviation. In the end, learning is the goal, and
this RCT did a marvelous job at advancing the field and will hopefully
place in a top journal.

# Notes on Conflicts of Interest

One of the authors of this paper (Julian Jamison) is a member of our
Field Specialist team. However, he was not part of the decision to
prioritize this paper, and we have managed this evaluation outside of
our normal interface, so he has not been able to see or be part of this
process.

    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^6]: The paper is framed, and the contribution posed mainly about
    unconditional trash transfers (UCT). However, the experiment was
    conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the paper is also
    about UCT during a pandemic. The authors are probably the first ones
    to study this, but this contribution should be made upfront. The
    authors, therefore, should relate to further literature on cash
    transfers during the pandemic. The paper has limited external
    validity given the end of the pandemic/conducting the experiment
    under very particular circumstances

    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^10]: My rating here is based on the data and its use, not the study's
    experimental design in the field, which (like many experiments)
    likely has many nuances in implementation.

[^11]: Methods and data collection is quite clear, data is not yet
    widely available since the paper has not been published. Beyond
    related literature, there are no resources that can enable future
    research.

[^12]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^13]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\

    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to

    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^14]: The paper relevance is limited for global priorities since the
    experiment was conducted during the COVID pandemic, weakening its
    external validity, and applications in other contexts. Nevertheless
    the question is important, given the wide use of conditional cash
    transfers. The transfers given in the experiment might have been
    low, 500 and 2000 USD, to find a positive effect, however larger
    cash transfers might be difficult to do practically, therefore the
    usefulness to practitioners might be limited. However, it is useful
    to know at least that smaller unconditional cash transfers have
    limited effects suggestion these should not be done. There is no
    assessment of quantified costs/benefits.
