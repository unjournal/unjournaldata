# Abstract 

This summarizes and links to the evaluations of the paper** **\"The
Governance Of Non-Profits And Their Social Impact: Evidence From A
Randomized Program In Healthcare In DRC" ([@temp_id_7572098131702797]).
We chose to evaluate this NBER paper because it addresses a question of
critical importance to global priorities, which is: how can non-profit
organizations improve their governance to increase their social impact?

## Evaluation manager's notes

We chose to evaluate this NBER paper because it addresses a question of
critical importance to global priorities, which is: how can non-profit
organizations improve their governance to increase their social impact?
Effective governance underpins the successful implementation of policies
and interventions across a range of areas, including health,
development, education and environment, and as the paper finds,
increases the beneficial social impacts of these interventions. By using
a rigorous, counterfactual design, the study authors contribute to this
important question in the context of health centers in the DRC.

We organized one evaluation of the paper.  This latest version (as of
February 2023) of the research paper can be found
[here](http://www.columbia.edu/~cf2870/PDFs/FangwaFlammerHuysentruytQuelin_MgtSci2023.pdf "null").
However, the evaluation was based on the earlier NBER working paper
version (dated: August 2022), available
[here](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30391 "null"). 

During the process of seeking a second evaluator, we noted that one of
the co-authors' webpages
([here](https://mariekehuysentruyt.com/working-papers/ "null"), accessed
May 2023) listed/linked the later version of the paper as "forthcoming"
in Management Science.  Although we are open to doing  'post-publication
evaluation', in this case, we chose to not pursue further evaluations.

The evaluator was asked to follow the general guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators "null").
In addition to written evaluations (similar to journal peer review), we
ask evaluators to provide [quantitative
metrics](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#metrics-overall-assessment-categories "null")
on several aspects of each article. These are put together below. For
this paper, we did not give specific suggestions on 'which aspects to
evaluate'.  

As a final note, although the authors did not engage with the
Unjournal's evaluation of this paper, we hope this evaluation may be
useful to other researchers working on similar topics.

[^1]: Tough to evaluate this criterion without a published paper to know
    whether replication data are available; I'm making a (pessimistic)
    conjecture about data shareability based on the data the researchers
    do and don't have access to in the paper as written
