# Abstract 

The main strengths of the paper are the use of a rigorous systematic
review methodology; the use of sound meta-analysis methods; and the
focus on women-level outcomes and on the goal of reducing gender
disparities. The results summarise the impact of highly heterogeneous
intervention on highly heterogeneous outcomes. The average effect sizes
shown are not very informative in relation to the policy goal of
selecting most effective intervention or the research goal of designing
better interventions. I recommend a) to provide a theoretical
justification for pooling highly heterogeneous interventions b) to
summarize effect sizes separately by intervention type and outcomes; c)
to include further explanatory factors in the meta-regression.

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The most important evidence statement of the paper is that social safety
net interventions benefit women, by improving their economic and agency
outcomes. In a meta-analysis pooling all effect sizes across all
outcomes and interventions, the average impact is of 0.11 standard
deviations. A secondary claim is that CCT and food voucher and in-kind
transfer are much less effective than other social safety net
interventions.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^5] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

The first claim is correct to the extent that it calculates an average
of effects across an heterogenous group of interventions and outcomes.
It leaves however some important questions unanswered: Is the impact
large? Does it reduce gender disparities? The second statement about CCT
intervention, is not fully supported by the result presented. Important
questions are unanswered: what are the most effective interventions and
for what outcomes?

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^6] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

The authors should report the results of the meta-analysis per
intervention type and per outcome. They should also consider other
metrics (such as percentage changes in the outcomes) to calculate the
effect sizes. The outcomes should also include \"leadership\" and
\"aspiration\" outcomes. The meta-regression should include additional
factors such as, for example, the size of the transfer, whether women
are recipient of the transfer, and should correct the analysis for the
presence of multicomponent interventions either with a sub-group
analysis, the inclusion of multicomponent interventions as a distinct
category in the meta-regression, or using component network
meta-analysis.

# Written report

**Summary**

The paper presents the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis
of social safety nets interventions (such as cash transfers, asset
transfers, and public works), on women's economic outcomes (such as
assets, expenditures, and labour market participation) and women's
agency outcomes (such as decision-making within the household, and
ability to speak out). It pools the results from 115 publications of
RCTs, and, using meta-analysis, it estimates average impacts of about
0.1 standard deviations for pooled "economic" and "agency" outcomes. An
analysis by intervention types shows that when all outcomes are pooled,
unconditional cash transfers, public works, social care services, and
asset transfers have similar positive effects, while conditional cash
transfers and food transfers have much smaller effects. The authors
carry out a meta-regression to explain the results with differences
between studies, interventions, and implementation characteristics.
However, they do not find significant differences across studies. The
study makes a valuable contribution to the literature because it
summarises the impact of interventions that are rarely analysed in
systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It could provide valuable evidence
in relation to the choice of social safety nets interventions that are
more likely to reduce gender disparities. The statistical analysis is
sound. The results are credible, but the interventions and outcomes
considered are highly heterogeneous, and the results are not very
informative.

## Relevance and contribution to literature

The paper makes an important contribution to the literature in various
ways. First, it summarises a large evidence base with a rigorous
systematic review and a meta-analysis. The introductory section of the
paper briefly reviews the existing literature on the subject. There are
several reviews of social safety nets interventions, including reviews
that focus on women's outcome specifically. However, these reviews
rarely employ rigorous systematic methods or conduct meta-analyses.

A second strength of the paper is its relevance to current debates about
social protection policies. The subject of the review -- the impact of
social protection intervention on women's outcomes -- is highly debated
and there is a need to understand whether the interventions reduce
gender disparities. The study assesses to what extent social protection
interventions benefit women and contribute to greater gender equality.
It aligns well to SDG5 and to efforts of major international
organisations and donors in this direction. The findings could inform
the selection of the most effective intervention and the design of
better interventions when the aim is reducing gender inequality.

A third strength of the paper is that the systematic review is
well-conducted. The systematic review was registered and followed a
published protocol. The methods of search, screening, and risk-of-bias
analysis were rigorously outlined and well implemented. The quantitative
methods employed are sound. The meta-analysis uses a robust variance
estimator (RVE) to address the issue of multiple impact estimates per
study, and the resulting within-study dependency of the estimates, thus
addressing an issue typical of the economics literature whereby many
effect sizes are reported for the same construct using different
indicators and model specifications. The study also makes a considerable
effort to analyse the heterogeneity of the results using a
meta-regression approach.

A final strength of the paper, which is not sufficiently stressed in the
text, is the focus on women's outcomes. Traditionally, evaluation
studies and household surveys have collected data on expenditures and
assets from "households" rather than from individuals. The collection of
individual data on expenditures and assets is a notable innovation of
surveys conducted over the last 10-15 years and a significant
contribution to our understanding of how resources are shared within
households. The paper summarises the women-level outcomes observed using
these new data collection methods.

## Impact assessment

The key finding of the study is that the interventions considered have a
positive impact on the selected economic and agency outcomes. The
average impact of all interventions on all pooled outcomes (economic and
agency) is found to be 0.11 standard deviations (0.11SD for economic
outcomes, and 0.10SD for agency outcomes). Although this result is
promising, since it points to a positive impact of the intervention, it
is ultimately difficult to interpret for at least two reasons.

First, the meta-analysis includes the following intervention categories:
CCT, UCT, public works, asset transfers, waivers and subsidies, social
care services, and food transfers. Some of these interventions are
similar, such as for example conditional and unconditional cash
transfers. Other interventions, however, are very different from each
other, such as for example public work programmes, students'
scholarships, or wage subsidies. Each of these interventions will affect
the outcomes considered through different pathways. If we were to map
the theories behind each program, they would presumably look very
different. The study however makes no attempt to present a unifying
programme theory of the interventions, which illustrate how they are
expected to affect the outcomes through similar mechanisms. In the
paper, the interventions are unified by a common goal of providing a
social safety net, but are otherwise an heterogenous bundle of different
interventions operating in different ways. Similarly problematic is the
heterogeneity of the outcomes. The study includes impacts on assets,
savings, expenditures, labour force participation, debt, work intensity,
care work, voice, autonomy, and decision making. Some of these outcomes
are similar to each other. For example, a transfer can either be saved
or spent and therefore assets, savings, and expenditures capture the
same construct. Other outcomes, however, are more difficult to group
into the same category. For example, participation in the labour market
and unpaid care work are affected more indirectly by a cash transfer and
cannot be easily grouped together with assets and expenditure. The
pooling of "economic" and "agency" measures is even more problematic as
these are very different constructs. In summary, the study is
summarising the impact of highly heterogeneous interventions on highly
heterogeneous outcomes. It is not clear what is the use or benefit of
estimating an average effect size summarising all the heterogeneity
across interventions and outcomes.

A second difficulty in interpreting the results relates to the metric
adopted. In order to pool the results, the authors standardized all the
results using standard deviation units. However, the benefits of
standardising economic outcomes are not clear. Economic variables like
assets and expenditure have very large standard deviations in typical
household surveys, and the standardized effect sizes will be very small.
More importantly, an increase in assets by 0.1 standard deviations is
difficult to interpret. Percentage changes in assets and expenditures
would provide a better understanding of the impact of the interventions.
It is very hard to conclude from the results whether the impact of the
interventions are large or small.

As an aside, there is also an issue in interpreting economic impacts as
a reduction of gender disparities. For example, some interventions
provide women with cash, or assets, and as a result women's expenditure,
assets or savings increase. The increase is interpreted as a success
because the economic gain could be in principle captured by other
household members. However, does this effect reduce gender disparities
as the authors suggest? Suppose the intervention increases on average
women's assets by 10% and men's assets by 20%. Would this still be
considered as a reduction in gender disparities? Shouldn't the change in
women's outcomes be measured relatively to the change in men's outcomes?
It seems that the review, addresses the question of whether social
safety nets benefit women, but does address the question of whether they
reduce gender disparities.

The authors' decision to employ a meta-regression to further analyse the
results suggest that they are aware of the difficulty of aggregating
many heterogeneous outcomes and interventions in the same meta-analysis.
They implicitly acknowledge that the most interesting aspects of the
study are a) the disaggregation of the results by intervention type and
by outcome type and b) the analysis of how impact varies across study
design, intervention type, and contextual characteristics. However,
their analysis of impacts by intervention type and by
study-intervention-context characteristics are not very informative.

The disaggregation of impacts by project type should tell us which
interventions are more effective for the different outcomes. The authors
present the average impacts of the intervention categories (for example
CCT, UCT etc.) on the pooled outcomes, and the impact of the pooled
interventions on economic and agency outcomes separately. However, what
we would like to see analysed is the impact of the different
interventions on economic and agency outcomes separately. This would
shed some light on which interventions are more effective in affecting
specific outcomes, which in turn would be relevant to inform the
selection and design of interventions.

The treatment of multicomponent interventions is also problematic. More
than half of the interventions are multicomponent and include more than
one intervention category (for example, some interventions consist of
CCT AND asset transfers, or asset transfers AND subsidies). In the
meta-analysis the authors considered these interventions multiple times
under CCT, transfers, subsidies etc. However, this does not help the
interpretation of the results, because the CCT interventions incwluded
in the meta-analysis also include "packages" of interventions that do
more than just transfers. This could also potentially explain the large
similarity of effects they found between interventions categories. In
summary, the presentation of the results by intervention type and
outcomes does not really help understanding which interventions are more
effective on what specific outcomes.

The meta-regression aims at analysing how impact vary with study design,
and intervention and contextual characteristics. It does not however
answer some important questions. First, as discussed above, we would
like to know which intervention affects which outcomes and it would be
preferable to conduct the meta-regression separately for economic and
agency outcomes. The reason is that the determinants of economic and
agency outcomes are very different, and we would expect the effects of
different interventions to vary. Second, some important factors appear
to be missing from the meta-regression which could be included using the
available data: a) The size of the transfer and the scale of the
intervention should matter. For example, a transfer corresponding to 30%
of average income should have a larger effect than a transfer
corresponding to just 10%. b) Whether the intervention is multicomponent
as discussed above is an important factor. The authors included in the
meta-regression a factor for "plus components" such as health services
and training, but they did not include factors for multicomponent
interventions. c) Whether the transfer, the work offer, the subsidy etc.
is offered to women directly or not. The authors included a factor for
targeted and non-targeted interventions, but it is not clear that this
implies that the recipient of the transfer/asset is a woman. The
literature suggests that the recipient of the transfer matters
considerably for its use.

In the conclusions, the authors state that UCT are more likely than CCT
to empower women. The evidence and the explanations provided in support
of this conclusion however are rather speculative. It is largely based
to the smaller effects of CCT on all outcomes. However, a different
conclusion could be obtained if we were to analyse separately the
results on agency and economic outcomes, and if we were to take into
account multicomponent interventions. Disaggregating impacts of the
interventions by outcome could also help understanding the reasons why
some interventions are more or less effective. The authors speculate
that CCT may restrict women choices about expenditure and may have some
disempowering effects. However, there is no evidence in the paper that
support this.

The conclusions discuss the absence of differences between targeted and
untargeted intervention. This result is indeed very surprising, because
you would expect that interventions targeted to women to a larger
impact. It seems that it should deserve some more reflection and
discussion.

Finally, the study concludes that the interventions "largely appear to
be smart investments". This is based on a review of the cost-analyses
found in 25 of the selected studies. The review however found that only
"a minority of studies including cost estimates" and of those that did
"few considered women's impacts". The review of cost-benefit analyses
did not produce clear results. The statement that the interventions are
"smart investments" does not appear to be fully supported by the
analysis of the data.

## Opportunities to improve the paper

I think the paper could be improved in several ways. First, there should
be a rationale for pooling heterogeneous interventions in the same
meta-analysis. The authors should illustrate a common theory or
mechanism behind the interventions that justify their pooling in a
single category of "social net interventions." They could develop a
meta-theory or mid-level theory of social safety net interventions that,
by identifying key common mechanisms, justifies pooling. The same theory
would also help predicting which intervention type should have an impact
on which outcomes and under what conditions, which in turn would help
decisions about pooling outcomes and including explanatory variables in
the meta-regression.

Second, the analysis could be improved in various ways:

a\) the meta-analysis should be conducted separately by intervention
types and by economic/agency outcomes, in order to understand which
interventions are more effective for which outcomes;

b\) the meta-analysis should include additional outcomes. The authors
did not include the results for "aspirations" and "leadership" because
of "low power", but it is not clear why they were not included in the
meta-analysis of all pooled outcomes. If low power is an issue, they
should report the number of studies and of participants so that the
reader can make their own judgement.

c\) The meta-regression should address the inclusion of multicomponent
interventions. This could be done in different ways. For example, the
authors could define the intervention categories in different ways (for
example by including a "graduation" category, of interventions including
multiple components); they could analyse standalone and multicomponent
interventions separately in a sub-group analysis or in the
meta-regression; finally, they could model the impact of standalone and
multicomponent interventions in a component network meta-analysis.

## How to improve impact

The paper could increase its impact if it were to provide results that
have more informative applications to the selection of projects and to
project design. A meta-analysis which analyses more in detail the impact
of different interventions on different outcomes could inform which
interventions are the most effective in reducing gender disparities and
on which particular dimension (economic or agency).

The paper could also provide valuable recommendations for research that
are currently not discussed. First, based on the review of
cost-effectiveness analysis the paper could recommend the collection of
cost data in RCTs of social protection interventions. The collection of
cost data and the discussion of the cost-effectiveness of development
interventions is often overlooked by researchers. The authors could
reflect on the small number of cost-effective analysis studies and
recommend methods for collecting cost data in RCTs. Second, the paper
could discuss a bit more the use of individual-level data. These data
are collected with different methods and variable quality. The authors
could summarise current best practices in the collection of these data
and recommending their use in all studies with the purpose of being able
to assess reductions in gender disparities.

## Minor points

The authors say that they found no evidence of publication bias.
However, my reading of Figure S4 in the appendix is that small
poor-quality studies (as measured by the Z-score) are more likely to
report positive results. The distribution of the effect sizes appears
heavily skewed to the right. The test reported by the authors seems to
reject publication bias, but the figure suggests that publication bias
should be explored a bit more.

Often the paper comments on the "robustness" of results, as in, for
example "impacts of from UCTs, social care and asset transfers are the
most robust" but it is not clear what is meant by robust in these cases.
Is it robustness of the results across outcomes, model specifications,
or other?

Similarly, the paper sometimes refers to statistical power in an unclear
way as in "CCT...are associated with lower effect sizes. We hypothesize
that low power and heterogeneity between studies may have contributed to
these minimal results." Statistical power cannot affect effect sizes.

The authors standardize the results using Hedges g. What is the
rationale for doing this? The sample sizes of the studies do not appear
to be small.

The authors display the effect sizes using an orchard plot because of
the large number of estimates. It would be useful also to display the
information using a forest plot, for example using the average effect
sizes within each study. Although such average study-level estimates
would not be correct, they would give a visual presentation of the
results and could be used as a benchmark against which to measure the
bias correction made using the RVE model.
