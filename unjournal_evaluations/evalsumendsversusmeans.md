# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Ends versus Means:
Kantians, Utilitarians, and Moral Decisions\"[@nr4suq5eut7]. In the
authors' experiments, participants (a standard university subject pool)
make a series of incentivized choices in games involving ends-vs-means
tradeoffs, including a "real stakes... trolley dilemma" and
rule-following, as well as standard self-versus-other choice tasks. The
goals: to measure moral behavior and preferences in "the... dimension of
consequentialism versus deontological ethics", the prevalence of these
behaviors, whether they reflect stable personal traits, and how they
relate to self/other social preferences. Measuring these preferences can
inform democratic policy choices (e.g., for medical triage situations)
as well as the choices and values of powerful artificial intelligence
models. The authors report a 20%-44% rate of apparently
nonconsequentialist choices, "no evidence of stable individual
\[consequentialist/deontological\] preference types across situations",
and little correlation to self/other choices. The evaluators generally
praise the approach and much of the execution, finding this paper
interesting and innovative. However, they raise substantial doubts about
several of the ends-vs-means games' designs, suggesting that the
participants' choices may not meaningfully represent deontological/moral
behavior as the authors claim. Both evaluators characterize this work as
falling short of definitive general evidence for 'the instability of
deontological preferences'. Hugh-Jones offers further *conceptual*
critiques of this general approach to eliciting moral preferences,
noting the importance of "innate intuitions" and "communication with
others". To read these evaluations, please see the links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## David Hugh-Jones

This paper reports an experiment on deontological (ends versus means)
preferences using incentivized experiments, including a "trolley
problem" where subjects can choose to save real lives.[^4]
Non-consequentialist preferences are common, but are situation-specific
and not linked to conventional social preferences such as altruism. The
experiment is well-executed, and results are credible and interesting.
Questions remain whether economic lab experiments are the best tool to
characterize subjects' ethical views.

## Valerio Capraro

I greatly appreciated the *Ends vs Means* paper, especially its effort
to bring moral dilemmas into economics. I see two main limitations in
the current version of the paper: (1) the Save a Life dilemma may
mischaracterize Kant's categorical imperative; (2) the finding of
unstable deontological preferences may depend on the dilemmas used. I
hope these issues will be resolved, as I think this paper has high
potential.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

*The discussion below was written by David Reinstein *

### The paper, evaluations, and critiques --- a take[^19]

In the authors' experiments, participants (a standard university subject
pool) make a series of incentivized choices in games involving
ends-vs-means tradeoffs, including a "real stakes... trolley dilemma"
and rule-following, as well as standard self-versus-other choice tasks.
The goals: to measure moral behavior and preferences in "the...
dimension of consequentialism versus deontological ethics", the
prevalence of these behaviors, whether they reflect stable personal
traits, and how they relate to self/other social preferences. The
authors report a 20%-44% rate (context-dependent) of apparently
nonconsequentialist choices, "no evidence of stable individual
\[consequentialist/deontological\] preference types across situations",
and little correlation to self/other choices.

The evaluators generally praise the approach and much of the execution,
finding this paper interesting and innovative. However, they raise
substantial doubts about several of the ends-vs-means games' designs,
suggesting that the participants' choices may not meaningfully represent
deontological/moral behavior as the authors claim. Both evaluators
characterize this work as falling short of definitive general evidence
for 'the instability of deontological preferences'. Hugh-Jones offers
further *conceptual* critiques of this general approach to eliciting
moral preferences, noting the importance of "innate intuitions" and
"communication with others".

I (David Reinstein) find the design criticisms rather plausible and they
seem to cast substantial doubt over some of the main claims,
particularly about the instability of deontological behavior and its
lack of correlation to standard prosocial preferences. Capraro notes
"there are many deontological rules and the fact that preferences over
one or some of these rules are not stable does not imply that
preferences over each of these rules are unstable." Indeed, if
consequentialist choices in these games elicit moral concerns, these are
diverse concerns (lying, causing harm as a side-effect of doing more
good, 'bribery'), and not everyone may hold each of these equally. For
preferences to be \"stable\" in the sense they are looking for, people
would need to all have the same values over a range of these moral
norms.

And to my impression, some of the stylized choices in these lab games
don\'t really trigger the moral norms implied, as Hugh-Jones point out.
Giving a lab participant two euros so that more is passed to a charity
doesn\'t really seem to me anything like bribing a public official. And
even the \"lying" situation they engineer in the lab feels more to me
like bluffing in a poker game than an important real-world lie.

### Why we chose this paper; impact

The Unjournal has not generally evaluated much 'classic experimental
economics' work, by which I mean small-scale trials with modest
incentives where participants know they are in an experiment. Nor have
we prioritized research trying to uncover deep preferences or test
fundamental behavioral models. We've largely favored policy-relevant
projects using meaningful field data and large-scale interventions (see
our [public database of prioritized
work](https://coda.io/d/Public-Database-of-Research_d7VdSLeCrpi/Unjournals-Research-with-potential-for-impact-database_suis00Dm#_luH-fkAg "null")
as well as our [collection of evaluation
packages](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/evaluation-summary-and-metrics "null")).
This paper is a bit of an exception --- so why did we think it was
potentially high-value?\
\
While large philanthropic groups associated with Effective Altruism
consider moral tradeoffs in their funding choices, these are generally
explicitly consequentialist (utilitarian); practical tradeoffs involve
'more people versus happier people', and 'saving infants' lives versus
adult lives', etc.[^20] Still, they make some considerations of
[worldview
diversification](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/worldview-diversification/ "null"),
including deontological \"side constraints,\" and have some cause to be
concerned with how their approaches might be viewed by the general
(voting) public.

This tends to be more of a concern for democratic governments.[^21] For
policy choices to reflect the will of the people, we might want to know
how people weigh maximizing the total good against other concerns, such
as fairness, lying, and treating people as a means to an end. Examples
could include medical triage situations and the "[Rule of
Rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Rescue "null")",
overstating the risks of drug use to children, putting people or groups
under quarantine during pandemics, bribery in foreign aid, vaccine
mandates, using torture or targeted killings for counterterrorism,
criminal sentencing evidence thresholds, and organ donation defaults.

But the largest factor in our prioritizing this was (probably) the
movement to instill human values in artificial intelligence (perhaps
AGI) models, which are seen as likely to make profound social decisions.
Projects like the [Moral Machine
Experiment](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0637-6 "null")
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Machine "null")) sought
to measure the preferences of broad segments of the global population
over choices autonomous vehicles would need to make in accident
situations, \~swerving one direction or another and trading off the
lives of specific numbers of people with different characteristics.

This can be as part of a broader project of trying to *quantify human
moral intuitions* so they can be encoded into the decision rules of AI
systems. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have at least made noises about this
([constitutional AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic "null") and
'[collective
alignment](https://openai.com/index/collective-alignment-aug-2025-updates/ "null")'),
while academic and research organizations (e.g., the [Center for
Human-Compatible
AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Human-Compatible_Artificial_Intelligence "null"))**
**have pursued a range of approaches, e.g., "[Moral Graph
Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636 "null")", the
"[Multi-Human-Value Alignment
Palette](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19198 "null")", and "[Value
Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_learning "null")".

### Insights (a quick and tentative stab)

To the extent that this paper's stated results are true, actionable
insights could include:

-   Deontological preferences are real and common; few people are purely
    consequentialist

-   Don't assume moral preferences are stable or reflect a simple and
    consistent moral belief system.

-   To understand preferences in a given setting, you need to consider
    the specific context, because context matters

-   These do not strongly correlate with self-vs-other preferences;
    other-regarding people (\~altruists) have a mix of preferences over
    truth-telling, using people as means-to-an-end, etc.

However, this paper's evidence alone is probably not sufficient to even
be confident about the above. The authors' followup, and more so, "a
range of different evidence" (as Hugh-Jones notes) may help garner
further insight. Evidence from choice trials like the aforementioned
Moral Machine experiment may be particularly fruitful. While these don't
offer incentives quite as tangible as those in this paper, if
participants' choices make are used to inform (e.g.) the behavior of
autonomous vehicles, they still offer a concrete impact, i.e., a 'moral
incentive'.

# Author engagement, process

The authors were informed about this process, but chose not to respond
(yet). Luca Henkel noted

> We are currently working on a new version of the paper and will use

[^15]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^16]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^17]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^18]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\

    tradeoffs](https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/moral-weights#GiveWells_current_approach_to_moral_weights)
    fed by preferences from surveys of their own team, their
    stakeholders, and the beneficiary groups. The results of this paper
    a might be relevant to the extent that they inform us about
    people\'s consistency in reporting on moral dilemmas and moral
    choices in a general sense.

[^21]: Mainstream NGOs and charities may face similar concerns in trying
    to effectively help the world's poorest people while being
    consistent with what they see as the fundamental ethical values of
    the people in those communities.
