# Preamble

Two evaluators considered the NBER working paper: ["Mental Health
Therapy as a Core Strategy for Increasing Human Capital: Evidence from
Ghana"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29407)
[@temp_id_06781749097532219]. They were asked to foll­­ow the general
guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators).
 For this paper we did not give specific suggestions on 'which aspects
to evaluate'. During this process, the paper (or perhaps a very similar
'forked' version) was accepted for publication in the journal AER:
Insights, with a changed title: "[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy among
Ghana\'s Rural Poor Is Effective Regardless of Baseline Mental
Distress](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20210612)"
[@temp_id_06869707343182008].  The second evaluator (and the first
evaluator, to a lesser extent) became aware of the latter version in the
process of writing their evaluation, and adjusted accordingly.\
\
Note that both evaluators chose to remain anonymous, so we will not
publish their names or identities.

The authors have been informed and given a chance to respond. We did not
hear back from them within the two-week waiting period. The authors are
still encouraged to respond, and if they do, we will post their response
here.

## **Evaluation Manager's Statement**

The two evaluations were generally positive about this work and its
important contribution to our understanding of the potential benefits of
psychotherapy programs in developing country contexts. However, the
evaluators did raise some concerns that would be useful to address. I'm
\[listing\] them here:

-   Access to survey materials would be useful for future replication
    efforts; the authors have already made available the analysis code
    to facilitate this

-   Both evaluators highlight that there was no evidence of
    heterogeneity by baseline mental health; however, it would be
    helpful to clarify if this was due to analyses being underpowered to
    identify small heterogeneous effects.

-   Although sample attrition was not mentioned in the NBER working
    paper, it has been addressed in the AER published version; however,
    some of the appendix content (Appendix Table 3) can be clarified,
    especially where coefficients are 0. A table note or some such
    should suffice

-   One evaluator also offers useful suggestions regarding the outcomes
    of this research 

# Metrics

In addition to written evaluations (similar to journal peer review), we
ask evaluators to provide [quantitative
metrics](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#metrics-overall-assessment-categories)
on several aspects of each article. These are put together below.
