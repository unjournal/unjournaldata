# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"The Effect of Public
Science on Corporate R&D\"[@n5sr5bylpkw]. The first evaluation
(anonymous ) is highly critical of the paper\'s identification strategy,
citing concerns such as collider bias and endogenous *shares*. The
second evaluator (Bournakis) is more positive, finding the results
surprising and convincing, suggesting a difference-in-differences
robustness check and raising several requests for clarifications and
justifications. The authors respond to the critiques in detail, offering
a robust public discussion of econometric identification in an applied
context. To read these evaluations and the responses, please see the
links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

The paper provides evidence on a recently relevant issue in science
policy: the spillover effects of public science. However, these effects
are not well-identified. There are numerous issues likely distorting the
identification, including bad controls and a shift-share design with
endogenous shares.

## **Ioannis Bournakis**

The paper develops a systematic framework for analysing how public
science capital affects corporate R&D, leveraging rich firm-level data
and extensive robustness checks to support credible causal inference. My
main question is whether this instrumental variables strategy offers
clear advantages over a difference-in-differences design.

# Evaluation manager's discussion

I am particularly pleased with the depth of these evaluations, and the
authors' responses. This is a particularly rich public discussion of
econometric identification issues in this applied context.

I intend to revisit this section to provide further synthesis and
discussion, but I do not want to delay the release of this evaluation
package further.[^31]

I left a few sidebar notes at various points in the PubPub interface;
these should not be interpreted as official Unjournal responses.

### Unjournal process notes

We shared
[these](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3k9Rb1fJXXbe1DQ4DyIKb7fU2JKmqlhOBsIYQif9nk/edit?tab=t.0 "null")
'bespoke evaluation notes' (leveraging LLM tools) with the evaluators.
These also contain some discussion of our process.

[^6]: The paper clearly states its primary research question: How do
    different aspects of public science influence corporate innovation
    activities? The approach is grounded in a thorough theoretical
    framework and supported by strong empirical evidence. The empirical
    strategy addresses potential endogeneity bias between corporate
    innovation activities and public knowledge, primarily by leveraging
    political shifts affecting agency R&D budgets. Although tackling
    (unobserved) endogeneity bias is an extremely challenging task in
    economics research, the authors\' attempt demonstrates a level of
    credibility that likely outweighs the potential limitations of the
    chosen approach. Providing results that establish causal inference
    adds significant value to the paper and strengthens the robustness
    of its empirical findings.

    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly

[^8]: This paper presents a significant and well-executed empirical
    study examining how public science, in its various dimensions,
    affects corporate research and development (R&D). The authors
    distinguish between three key components of public science: abstract
    knowledge (e.g., scientific publications), human capital (e.g., PhD
    scientists), and public inventions (e.g., university patents). Their
    findings that corporate R&D is driven more by embodied knowledge in
    human capital and inventions than by abstract knowledge itself
    offers important insights for science policy and innovation
    management.

    The study contributes to our understanding of how knowledge transfer
    mechanisms operate in practice and challenges conventional wisdom
    that treats public science primarily as a non-rival, purely
    spillover-driven input to private innovation. By leveraging
    firm-level exposure to exogenous shifts in federal R&D budgets tied
    to political subcommittee composition, the paper advances causal
    inference in this domain. Its nuanced implications---for example,
    the crowding-out effect of public invention on corporate R&D---are
    particularly relevant in an era of increasing university-industry
    partnerships and policy attention to innovation ecosystems.

[^9]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^10]: The paper applies an instrumental variables (IV) estimation to
    identify the causal impacts of public science on corporate
    innovation. Specifically, it uses a Bartik-style shift-share IV,
    where the "shifts" are changes in federal agency R&D budgets,
    expected to represent exogenous shocks driven mainly by the
    political composition of Congress. The "shares" are firm-specific
    exposures based on past patenting activity, publications, or
    dissertation overlaps.

    The validity of this instrument depends on the assumption that
    political shifts in R&D funding are exogenous to firm-specific
    innovation shocks. Admittedly, this is a reasonable assumption
    within this context, although the presence of weak identification
    might persist, particularly for large firms, especially considering
    spatial dimensions that may be interrelated with the determination
    of the federal budget. The authors are aware of this concern and
    address it by controlling for potential firm size effects through
    the inclusion of lagged R&D stock or annual sales in all relevant
    specifications. This is convincing and sufficient to argue that the
    presented results are not significantly biased, especially given the
    inherent challenges of identifying causal relationships in models of
    this kind.

    Nonetheless, I would like to suggest that the authors consider
    whether a difference-indifferences (DiD) approach could also be used
    to address the endogeneity bias between public knowledge and
    in-house innovation efforts. I do not claim that a DiD approach 2
    would necessarily outperform the strategy they have already
    employed, but it could serve as an additional robustness check. For
    example, one could identify a subset of firms more exposed to
    changes in public science funding (e.g., firms active in fields
    funded by certain agencies) and another subset less exposed, and
    then compare their innovation outcomes before and after the shocks,
    assuming the timing of R&D budget changes is exogenous. From the top
    of my head, one could think of firms heavily linked to NASA
    subfields versus those linked to the Department of Agriculture. This
    could be an interesting extension if the firm panel allows for such
    an analysis.

    In any case, the current identification strategy has strong merits
    and mitigates endogeneity concerns in a reasonable and convincing
    manner.

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: The goals and questions of the paper are clearly articulated: the
    authors seek to disentangle the distinct effects of public
    knowledge, human capital, and public inventions on corporate
    innovation activities. Key concepts are well defined, and the
    framework guiding the empirical analysis is transparent and
    logically developed.

    Nonetheless, I have some specific queries that I would like to
    raise. In Equation 3.1, is the variable r a stock variable
    (representing cumulative knowledge) or just a flow variable? I am
    aware that later in the paper, the authors treat public knowledge as
    a stock variable using the perpetual inventory method, but in the
    theoretical setup, this is not made explicit. It might be useful for
    the authors to clarify this point clearly from the very beginning.

    Additionally, regarding the function phi in the profit maximization
    problem: could it be subject to constant returns to scale (CRS)
    instead of diminishing returns to scale (DRS)? The authors
    implicitly assume that the productivity of investment falls with
    respect to both human capital and public knowledge. This is my
    understanding based on the setup of the model in Section 3.1, unless
    I am missing something. While this is a conventional assumption,
    would it not also be possible to allow for CRS or even increasing
    returns to scale (IRS) if the use of new knowledge capital (either
    internal or external to the firm) generates spillovers that lead to
    new ideas at a constant or increasing rate? In other words, is there
    any role for unintended spillovers in the model that could
    counteract the diminishing returns assumption? This is just a
    question and may not be crucial for the modelling approach, but it
    could be worth considering or clarifying.

    Furthermore, I was wondering whether the authors included the level
    dummy for high ability in the regressions of Table 10, since they
    are using the interaction term between public investment and human
    capital. Isn't it the case that these regressions should also
    include the dummy variable itself? Regarding this point, do we need
    to report the overall effects of the variables of interest (public
    investment and human capital) in Tables 10 and 11 etc, given that
    they are interacted with industry fixed effects, especially in Table
    11? Also, why does the dependent variable in Tables 10, 11, and 12
    include only the time subscript but not the firm subscript? Are we
    missing something here?

    In Section 3.2.4, the authors distinguish between leaders and
    followers. While the paper specifically focuses on the U.S., I would
    like to raise a question about whether there could also be a role
    for a global frontier instead of just a national frontier, as well
    as the potential impact of international public knowledge capital.
    The authors have deliberately excluded non-U.S. PhDs from the
    empirical analysis. This choice merits further justification. Is
    this decision conceptually meaningful? Is the influence of
    international public knowledge capital on U.S. corporations truly
    negligible? Admittedly, U.S. firms are typically positioned at the
    international technological frontier, but there might be sectors
    where the U.S. lags behind other countries. Have the authors
    considered these possibilities?

    Overall, the central point of the paper---that there is a potential
    trade-off between public invention as a competitor versus as an
    input---is carefully and convincingly developed.

[^13]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^14]: The paper demonstrates strong adherence to reproducibility
    standards. The dataset--- DISCERN---is publicly available through
    Zenodo, and the variable construction is extensively documented in
    appendices. The use of machine learning (SPECTER) for textual
    similarity analysis between patents and PhD dissertations is clearly
    explained and appropriately validated.

    The authors also conduct multiple robustness checks and use
    alternative operationalizations of their key variables (e.g.,
    alternative definitions of public invention using SPECTER-based
    similarity). Data integrity appears solid, with comprehensive
    coverage of firm-level R&D activity over a long time span
    (1986-2015) and linkage across several high-quality data sources,
    including Compustat, PatentsView, Dimensions, and ProQuest. I
    recommend that the authors enhance reproducibility by releasing
    anonymized intermediate datasets and code snippets for key
    transformations, and by archiving their data‐processing scripts
    (e.g., on GitHub). This would enable other scholars to leverage the
    same data pipeline for related research in innovation, human
    capital, and public knowledge.

[^15]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^17]: This paper offers valuable insights for both policymakers and
    practitioners concerned with the real-world impacts of public
    investment in science. The finding of this research that public
    inventions may substitute for internal R&D---especially among
    follower firms---has practical implications for how universities
    license technologies and for how governments design innovation
    policies.

    The focus on firm heterogeneity, such as differences between
    technology frontier and follower firms, adds depth and policy
    relevance. Quantitative estimates (e.g., a one standard deviation
    increase in relevant public invention reduces firm patents by 51%)
    provide actionable metrics for prioritization. By highlighting that
    only embodied knowledge (in people or patents) translates into
    corporate R&D investment, the study guides more effective knowledge
    transfer strategies.

    In sum, this paper represents a rigorous, transparent, and
    policy-relevant contribution to the field of corporate R&D
    investment and public knowledge capital. It challenges the commonly
    used assumption that there are spillovers from public investment in
    knowledge, systematically exploring the hypothesis of whether there
    is complementarity or substitutability between public investment and
    in-house innovation activity. This approach provides a more refined
    understanding of how public investment in research 5 shapes
    private-sector innovation, which remains among the most important
    sources of economic growth.

[^20]: I believe this paper has strong prospects for publication both in
    a top field-specific journal and in a leading general-interest
    journal.

[^21]: I can see this paper get published in European Economic Review or
    in Economic Journal. For a more field journal, Journal of economic
    growth can also be suitable for this paper but I believe the benefit
    from a more general field journal will be higher.

[^22]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^23]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^24]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^25]: Cut: "Section 6 of the paper provides the most crucial remarks
    for policy designers and practitioners. I would further highlight
    three points."

[^30]: Full response:\
    \
    \> I recommend adding the robustness check I mentioned in my report:
    implementing a difference-in-differences identification strategy.
    Iʼm not suggesting it would necessarily outperform the current IV
    approach, but it would offer the authors a valuable alternative
    perspective. A well-designed Dif-in-Dif should be feasible in this
    context and would help verify whether the results hold under a
    different identification scheme.\
    \
    It may not change the results at all---in which case, it would
    simply robustify the paperʼs existing findings. If the results do
    change, that would open a different line of inquiry. Either way,
    this suggestion is hypothetical at this stage but could strengthen
    the studyʼs contribution.\

[^31]: It has been somewhat more challenging to find evaluators for
    research in the economics of innovation relative to other areas.
    However, I am very happy with the expertise and care provided in
    this case.
