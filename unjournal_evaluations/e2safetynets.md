# Abstract 

The paper helpfully reviews the impact of social safety nets (SSNs) on
gender inequality. It highlights that SSNs can enhance women\'s economic
achievements and agency, particularly through increased labour force
participation and decision-making power. However, the effects on care
work intensity are not significant. The cost-benefit analysis is limited
due to a lack of comprehensive data. The paper is an excellent resource,
but needs some improvements on policy suggestions.

# Claim identification and assessment [^4]

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^5] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The authors \[state\] that there is sufficient robust quantitative
evidence to support the claim that social safety nets (SSNs) have the
potential to address gender inequality by enhancing women\'s economic
achievements (specifically labour force participation and productive
work intensity) and agency. The same is not true for other indicators
such as impacts on voice, autonomy, and care work intensity.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^6] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

I believe this claim fully as within my own work on social protection in
lower income countries over the past 20 years, it is clear that SSNs
have the ability to support and promote productive and growth impacts.
The frequent myth that SSNs lead to dependency and laziness is
misguided, especially in lower income countries, and this evidence
supports my long held belief. That said, this is an aggregate/average
result\...that needs to be contextualised

# Written report

The paper addresses the interesting question of the extent to which
social safety nets (SSNs) are able to address drivers of gender
inequality. The purpose is to gain a better understanding of the
potential of SSNs to reverse gender gaps. While there is established
narrative and anecdotal evidence to support the claim that SSNs increase
women's economic achievements and promote their agency within households
and communities, the authors want to establish whether there is robust
quantitative evidence to answer this question. In addition, the authors
broaden the scope of previous analyses that primarily focus on cash
transfers by including a range of other social assistance modalities --
food, assets, cash and vouchers,

The authors conduct a systematic review that comprises '1,307 effect
sizes representing 115 publications, 218,828 women across 45 low- and
middle-income countries.' The methods and methodology are well justified
and applied in a robust and transparent way. The annex and description
of methods are impressive and inspire confidence for the reader in the
research.

This is a very timely (due to the recent global expansion of SSNs and
the surge in evaluations of the same) and useful paper, contributing to
our knowledge and understanding of the impacts of SSN on gender specific
outcomes. For a researcher that works at the interface of research,
evaluation, policy and programming, it is incredibly helpful to have a
robust systematic review to hand, especially in light of a dominant
narrative in a number of policy circles that suggests that cash
transfers and social assistance leads to dependency. This is not born
out in the evidence presented here, in fact, quite the opposite. This,
in and of itself, is a useful lever to influence current policy
discussions and are increasingly requiring evidence of economic growth
potential from any social welfare payments (something that the authors
would do well to integrate into their discussion section). The evidence
here suggests that SSNs can be seen as an investment given the
significant outcomes on economic achievement -- especially labour force
participation and productive work intensity. Furthermore, the results
show that SSN have strong and positive impacts on voice, autonomy and
decision-making.

The null effects and limited impacts identified on care work intensity
is understandable given the countries represented by the data and the
fact that changes in patterns of care can take years, if not decades to
shift. Furthermore, as the authors point out, the number of studies in
the sample that look at these effects are very small (n=16). More
research would be usefully conducted in this area.

The cost benefit analysis is relatively weak compared to other parts of
the paper, but this is due to the limited number of studies that report
CBA. Furthermore, the variety of ways that costs and returns are
evaluated mean that they are often not comparable across interventions.
Gender specific benefits and costs are not included in these
calculations and the shortness of time that the interventions are being
evaluated over means that the conclusions on costs and benefits are
limited. Then analysis helpfully clearly demonstrates the case for
further research in this area.

The authors make an effort to point out the limitations of their work
and results -- something that is very welcome. The key limitations
relate to :

1.  Lack of programme design detail and contextual detail and would help
    to unpick variation across contexts and types of programme. For
    instance, cash plus programmes are highly variable in what they
    offer and in their objectives. Aggregating them all into one
    category can be misleading. In fact, I would challenge one of the
    statements in the conclusion that indicates that the findings align
    with recent review on early childhood outcomes which concludes that
    cash plus was rarely more effective than cash alone. This study,
    specifically, cannot say anything about cash plus versus cash only
    as there is not enough contextual information to draw conclusions
    (as confirmed by the authors themselves).\

2.  Low variability in gender targeting means that the conclusions must
    be treated with caution.\

3.  The short-term nature of the interventions and evaluations in the
    sample. We would expect stronger impacts the closer the evaluation
    is to the intervention. Overtime, we might expect the impacts to
    dampen or revert to pre-intervention levels. The sample does not
    enable the authors to evaluate these longer term impacts.

I would say that the policy implications are weak -- I have already made
reference to this above and I have suggested a line to take in
strengthening this section. I think the conclusion on unconditional
modalities makes sense and this can be promoted as a better way of
achieving outcomes around gender parity than conditional transfers. It
also appears that food is not as beneficial to woman as other forms of
provision, however, I wonder if context has been controlled for. For
instance, where markets are thin, inflation is high, banking is limited
and where conflict and fragility are key constraints to moving and
spending money, would food not be a better option in these contexts?
Maybe a few lines with a contextual interpretation of the key findings
would help.

I would also ask the authors to elaborate more on their conclusions :
'we encourage policymakers and practitioners to adopt existing practical
recommendations, including eliminating barriers that may limit women's
access to SSNs, extending coverage to previously excluded groups,
investing in linkages with complementary services and prioritizing
women's leadership and political voice in decision-making structures.'
Can the authors give some practical examples and advice?

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this paper. Congratulations to the
authors.

## Minor points:

1.  I am curious as to whether the authors definition of SSN includes
    school feeding, and if not, why not?\

2.  Editing errors highlighted in red \[now in quotes\]:
