# Abstract 

This study explores animal welfare costs of meat consumption, using
stated preference methods from a sample of Belgians to elicit
willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) measures for
animal welfare. While the theoretical framework is robust and the
research attempts to mitigate several biases, the small sample size and
reliance on open-ended WTP elicitation limit reliability. The study
provides valuable insights into relative animal welfare costs and
consumer preferences, serving as a foundation for future research.

# Written report

This is a study of farm animal welfare externalities associated with
consumption of three frequently consumed types of meat: beef, pork, and
chicken. The author conceptualizes monetized animal welfare measures
using a social welfare function that is additive in human utility and
farm animal utility. Human willingness to pay (WTP) for meat corresponds
to a standard measure of compensating variation. A representative
agent's "extended" utility, which derives from experiencing
(hypothetically) both a human and animal existence, leads to an
indifference condition defining the minimum willingness to accept (WTA)
to experience the life of the animal. Towards eliciting these WTP/WTA
measures, the study describes hypothetical scenarios in a survey to 170
respondents (mainly university students) in Belgium. Respondents are
asked whether they would prefer a situation in which they would fall
into a long sleep in which they experience a realistic/lifelike
(temporary) dream in which they were a farmed animal, or a situation in
which they would fall into a long sleep with no dream. Each respondent
is asked (in randomized order) about six hypothetical animals: broilers,
pigs, and beef cows from conventional farms; a broiler from a farm with
reliable animal welfare practices, a welfare neutral animal, and the
happiest animal imaginable. Each respondent is randomized into receiving
a question about WTP for their preferred option or WTA for their
unpreferred option, with a follow-up question about the certainty of
their response. Consumer marginal WTP for animal welfare is assessed
using an open-ended contingent valuation (CV) elicitation for
cruelty-free chicken, pig, and cow meat (in randomized order), with a
certainty-scale follow-up question.

Using a relative WTP measure, the study finds that over 80% of the
trimmed sample of respondents believe the lives of animals from
conventional farms are not worth living, though 59% believe the happiest
animal imaginable has a life worth living. In euros per kilogram of
meat, the median external animal welfare costs are zero for the
conventional and "better life" chicken, pig and cow, though the mean
values are higher. By contrast, consumers' marginal WTP for animal
welfare ranges between €3/kg (chicken) and €9.20/kg (beef). External
climate costs translate to an annual value of \$266 per average meat
consumer in Belgium, though a carbon tax could result in
\$32/person/year in added welfare costs as a result of substitution
across products.

There are several things to like about this research. The theoretical
framework is carefully developed and results in a set of interesting
compensating variation claims that nicely motivate the survey work. The
research acknowledges a wide array of potential biases---hypothetical,
social desirability, and information-based---and attempts to mitigate
these in various ways (though, those biases are likely still present in
the result, unfortunately). In a certain sense, the work here is
comprehensive: the survey instrument elicits both WTP and WTA,
calculated on both an absolute and relative scale, with analyses of both
mean and median values. Although there are methodological issues, many
of which are explicitly addressed, the paper stands as a nice launching
point for further work using CV methods to enlarge our understanding of
farmed animal welfare costs. In other words, the research questions
addressed here are fiendishly difficult to answer, but by enumerating
the many potential pitfalls, it serves as a useful reference for later
research that could resolve one or more of the very tricky issues in
this literature.

## Comments

**Sample Size and Composition**

One major issue affecting the results is the small sample size. Roughly
500 Belgian adults in an online panel were contacted, though 301
completed the survey and answered the test question reliably. After
applying three (logical) exclusion criteria, 170 remained. Such sample
sizes may not be large enough to detect true effects, which was pointed
out in various places throughout the article. Moreover, though the
sample was designed to be representative of the gender and age
distribution of the Flemish population, it is unclear if it is also
representative along education and income lines. These latter two
demographic features are frequent targets in survey sampling. The fact
that 51% of the sample completed undergraduate or post-graduate studies
suggest that these results most likely hold for that demographic group,
though this could be easily checked in a follow-up survey.[^4]

**Consumer Marginal WTP for Animal Welfare**

The research uses an open-ended CV question as the basis of the
estimates of consumer marginal WTP for animal welfare: What is the
maximum amount that you are willing to pay extra for a kilogram of
cruelty-free chicken, pig, cow (in randomized order). Open-ended
questions like these are known to suffer from hypothetical bias, as
mentioned throughout the research, and are not by themselves considered
a best practice for stated preference studies (e.g., Johnston et al.,
2017)[@johnston_contemporary_2017]. These also tend to have high
cognitive load relative to, say, double-bounded dichotomous choice or a
discrete choice experiment.[^5] Though these particular results are a
useful starting point, I do not find them highly credible, but I do
agree with the conclusion that it can help inform our understanding of
relative magnitudes. In the future, it will be important for follow-up
work to follow best practices in the value elicitation literature
(Johnston et al., 2017)[@johnston_contemporary_2017].

**Anthropocentric Valuation**

While the research here includes various methods for reducing biases and
is very open about the lack of robustness in certain areas (i.e., the
WTA results are very sensitive to the sample trimming methods), it is a
nice first attempt to answer some of the most important questions in
farm animal welfare economics using survey methods. That said, the
results derive from humans' estimations of non-human animal life. In
some sense, though, it would be better for non-human animals to do this
valuation, though this would take a clever research design by animal
behavior researchers (e.g., Prof. Sarah Brosnan's work is somewhat
related). Partial measures relate to animal self-endangering behavior
and suicide, but these have their own important limitations (e.g.,
valuations of "ending existing life" are not at all equal to valuations
of a "life not worth living to begin with").

**Policy Recommendations**

The short section on meat taxation and the trade-off with climate
impacts, while highly interesting and a useful extension of the main
WTP/WTA results, are perhaps too simplistic for policymakers. The major
point being conveyed is that policies inducing consumers to substitute
chicken for beef and pork would tend to increase animal welfare costs,
all else equal. This follows from the results, and from other studies in
the literature, though more targeted policy recommendations---following
from more complete policy modelling---are likely to be more
effective.[^6] A flat carbon tax on these three animal products would
tend to not cause this kind of substitution, but so could other forms of
policy mechanisms, including various cap-and-trade schemes. A better
approach would have been to highlight a few different competing
policies, politically feasible from the perspective of the governing
body, and calculate how those policies would have affected the animal
welfare costs---individually and in aggregate.

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^7] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The most impactful claim in Bruers (2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] is the
following: the median estimate of the animal welfare cost of chicken
meat is 10 euro/kg, whereas its mean estimate is several orders of
magnitude higher. The evidence underlying this comes from a survey of
Belgian consumers conducted in 2022, who are responding to a
hypothetical valuation question that involves how much money they would
be willing to accept for getting the experience of chickens from a
conventional farm. This claim is the most important because it 1)
provides further quantification of animal welfare externalities, 2)
suggests a high degree of variability, and 3) indicates that some
consumers have valuations that are very large by most measures.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above? {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

Since the underlying survey was performed in only one country, using a
small sample, and with methods that are not completely free of
hypothetical bias, I do not find the point value itself credible.
However, it could help inform non-zero lower bounds on the intrinsic
value of animal welfare for use in animal-related regulations.

[^4]: I agree. The sample size is small, but I doubt that a larger
    sample size could mitigate the two major problems:

    -   the discrepancy between WTA and WTP (comparable to an extremely
        large endowment effect), and

    -   the discrepancy between median and mean (i.e. the skewness of
        the distribution).

[^5]: **Author's Response (Stijn):** A discrete choice experiment might
    be preferred (this could mitigate the discrepancy between WTA and
    WTP). The present survey could be used as a pilot study for a DCE,
    to determine optimal attribute levels. Nevertheless, the
    hypothetical nature of the choices remains.

    academic field of animal welfare economics, where one of the aims is
    to construct more complete models for optimizing human and animal
    welfare.
