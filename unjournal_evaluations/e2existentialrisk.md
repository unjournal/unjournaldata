# Abstract 

The paper examines how hazard rates change with varying speeds of
technological advancement, questioning the wisdom of slowing progress.
It finds a trade-off between technological progress and safety as
countries prosper under optimal policies, illustrating a Kuznets curve
where hazard rates decrease post-technological advancement. Despite its
critical inquiry into whether technology jeopardizes society, it
overlooks integrating a benefit function with hazard assessment. This
omission limits the ability to assess technology\'s overall impact. With
adjustments, it merits publication in a 3-star journal, likely achieving
acceptance after revisions.

# Written report

## General Assessment

The paper analyses the evolution of hazard rates when technological
development occurs at different paces. As technological progress induces
risks, the fundamental question posed by the authors is whether it would
be meaningful to decelerate technological progress. The paper answers
that as countries become richer under optimal policy, there is a
trade-off between consumption and safety. Therefore, a Kuznets curve is
observed, with the hazard rate falling after technology advances. My
general comment is that the paper, undoubtedly, deals with a crucial
question: whether technology threatens the global community. Despite the
general relevance of this question, I think there is a misleading point
in not modeling any benefit function along with the hazard function.
Without considering both benefits and potential risks of technology
within the same framework, it is impossible to identify whether
technology induces existential catastrophes for society. A simple
argument can illustrate this point. Technological advancements have
contributed to environmental degradation, yet within the same
technological evolution, we can create technologies that are more
environmentally friendly and mitigate the negative impact on the
environment. Not modelling the potential gains from accelerating or
decelerating technological development is the biggest omission in the
current approach. My overall assessment of the paper, based on my
experience in the field, suggests that with some modifications, it
should be suitable for publication in a 3-star journal (ABS ranking). I
predict that after revisions, it will be accepted in a journal ranked at
the 3-star level (either field or general).

## Specific Feedback 

Before providing feedback on specific categories, I have some additional
comments:

• I found the title somewhat inaccurate. I think the word "Growth"
should be replaced with "Technological Progress" or simply "Technology."

• The discussion would benefit from more examples regarding trade-offs
following accelerated technological progress.

• Further on the above point, the statement that civilization encounters
the probability of a risk of an existential catastrophe due to
technological progress is thought-provoking but should be elaborated
with some examples. One needs to be more specific (preferably earlier in
the paper) regarding the precise sources of this threat. Is it going to
be from environmental degradation, an artificial virus emerging from lab
experiments, or the continuous progress of artificial intelligence?-How
plausible is the assumption that technology grows exogenously?

• Have the authors considered the case where 𝐴 induces a constant
hazard, regardless of how quickly the increase occurs? This approach
seems more straightforward and might also allow for including a
technology-related benefit function within the same framework. This
setup seems more realistic, offering a greater scope for policy design.

• The statement that technological growth ( 𝐴̇ \| 𝐴 ) has been roughly
constant over the last century must be backed up by references. It is
difficult to treat this as a universal point without supporting
evidence.

• On page 34, does this statement describe the case where the risks
posed by two events occurring simultaneously are associated with
certainty, while the sequence of events might induce uncertainty, as we
do not know the exact intensity of the risk? *"One valid criticism of
this functional form is that it overemphasises a channel through which
the risks posed by a series of technological developments can be cheaper
to mitigate if they occur at once than if they occur in sequence."*

• On page 8, the statement *"Unlike temporary accelerations, however,
permanent accelerations can render survival possible when otherwise
impossible. Shrinking a heavytailed curve with an infinite integral can
yield a thin-tailed curve with a finite integral"* has mathematical
meaning but needs to be placed within a more intuitive context, possibly
with some examples. For instance, what can be an example of a temporary
acceleration of technological progress? In the context of artificial
intelligence, how can permanent acceleration of AI render survival
possible, while temporary acceleration cannot? What are the key
characteristics of temporary acceleration that affect survival? These
abstract concepts should always be placed in a context to become more
understandable.

## Specific Assessment 

**1. Overall assessment: 65%**

The paper explores a topical issue: the relationship between
technological development (or progress) and existential risk. This
objective is crucial, as we need approaches that help us understand the
risks induced by technological change. Recent developments in the global
community, such as vaccines and the evolution of AI, fall within this
agenda and certainly deserve a more systematic analysis. One remark I
can make here is that the definition of existential risk is too broad
and, in that sense, not entirely accurate. It is difficult to argue that
some types of technological progress can threaten the very existence of
humanity. This does not seem meaningful. However, the value and
contribution of the present analysis are not significantly affected if
the authors could be more specific when referring to the risks induced
by technological progress. For example, the evolution of AI can induce
many risks in various aspects of economic life alongside its undeniable
benefits. The analysis would become much more meaningful if placed
within this context. Similarly, how further technological progress can
affect environmental degradation, which can indeed be an existential
issue for humanity, should be explored. Overall, I would say that the
objectives of the project are definitely crucial. It would be more
useful to elaborate more on their application in specific contexts.

**2. Advancing our knowledge and practice: 55%**

One key message of the present analysis is that technological progress
(or development, according to the authors' terminology) follows a
pattern similar to the Kuznets curve, where the hazard initially
increases as technology evolves at a slower rate and then declines after
reaching a certain point beyond which technology progresses faster. This
statement seems somewhat arbitrary, and I am not convinced that this
thesis adequately describes the relationship between technological
evolution and hazards after reading the entire paper. I do not want to
argue that this thesis of authors is invalid, but I would find it more
appropriate to assume a constant hazard independent of how quickly
technology evolves. After all, to understand the role of technology one
needs to consider that risks coexist with benefits.

I found it challenging for a theoretical framework like the one provided
in the paper to robustly establish this pattern. Whether technological
progress and hazard exhibit a monotonic relationship is more a matter of
empirical scrutiny, which is not the scope of this paper. Additionally,
the broad definition of existential risk makes it even more difficult to
justify the Kuznets relationship. For example, according to the
authors\' approach, the evolution of mRNA vaccination technology
initially induces proportionally more risks, which then decrease as the
technology standardizes without too many new developments. However, the
crucial question is whether the benefits outweigh the risks of this
technological evolution at all stages and all paces of development. One
could argue that despite the temporary acceleration of mRNA technology,
the benefit rate has been greater than the hazard rate. What is the view
of the authors on this? Therefore, even a temporary acceleration of
technology can be beneficial on net, without implying that survival
becomes impossible, as outlined in Section 2.

Overall, I think the analysis lacks a function that accounts for the
potential benefits of technological progress. While there is a
systematic analysis of the evolution of the hazard rate, the model
should also incorporate the rate of benefits. The crucial point is to
develop a framework that improves our understanding of which outcome
prevails in the state of technological progress and under which
conditions. I believe this is a significant omission.

**3. Methods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness: 85%**

This paper provides a theoretical framework that is rigorous, coherent,
and well-executed. While there may be objections regarding the empirical
validity of some propositions, the analysis is thorough, and all
propositions are mathematically proven, indicating the internal
consistency of each argument. Certainly, there is further scope for
robustness analysis, especially if the authors could have guided how to
empirically test some of these hypotheses. I recognize that this is not
the scope of the present work, but perhaps the authors could add a few
sentences indicating future research directions in this area.

**4. Logic and communication: 70%**

Section 3 assumes that technology evolves exogenously. For the sake of
simplicity, this assumption is convenient. However, it is difficult to
accept that investment in new technological advances is driven solely by
external factors, rather than by firms\' needs to develop products that
meet specific demands and capture new market opportunities. Assuming an
endogenous approach to technology would make it easier to understand my
earlier point that technological evolution is often driven by firms
responding to market needs and opportunities. Furthermore, it\'s
important to explore how the benefits of technological 5 advancements
often outweigh potential risks and threats. This aspect deserves more
detailed discussion, especially in the conclusions of the paper. Some
parts of the discussion, particularly in the conclusions, do not always
convey a clear message and could benefit from further elaboration.

**5. Open, collaborative, replicable science: 75%**

The analysis posits a theoretical explanation of whether technological
development can lead to existential risks. This is a strong assertion
that lends itself to theoretical testing, though empirical validation is
often less straightforward. As I already suggested, the authors could
examine specific instances of technological advancements in particular
domains to ascertain whether the hazard rate outweighs the benefit rate
and whether technological evolution has indeed elevated society to a
higher steady-state condition. Such an approach would facilitate the
replication of the theoretical propositions in practical scenarios. In
the current context, it would have been beneficial if the authors had
proposed how the present model could lead to a reduced-form equation
that serves as a benchmark for empirical formulation. I remain skeptical
about the feasibility of this suggestion but believe it warrants
consideration.

**6. Real World Relevance: 68%**

The present analysis addresses a critical real-world issue: whether
technological progress induces existential risks. Given the multitude of
technological challenges we face today, this question is crucial.
However, a significant limitation of the analysis is its high level of
aggregation, which often hinders the identification of specific
implications for different sectors.

**7. Relevance to global priorities: 60%**

The analysis touches upon global priorities concerning the importance of
policy interventions to mitigate hazards arising from technological
progress. Yet, the paper falls short in providing clear policy
implications or defining specific domains for potential policy
initiatives. One clear implication from the analysis is the need for
varying levels of policy intervention tailored to the technological
development stage of each country. For instance, wealthier economies
experiencing accelerated technological progress may face lower risks,
whereas less developed countries with slower technological advancement
are at higher risk and thus require more intensive (or targeted) policy
interventions. However, the paper lacks 6 specific recommendations on
optimal policy measures. I believe the analysis would benefit from
including a section outlining indicative points for a policy
intervention roadmap tailored to different technological regimes
(accelerated vs. decelerated)
