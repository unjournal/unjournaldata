# Abstract 

This is an excellent paper that makes significant contributions to
climate policy evaluation. The authors\' application of the MVPF
framework to analyze 96 US environmental policies provides valuable
insights that traditional cost-per-ton metrics often miss. The key
contribution is to develop and meticulously apply the MVPF framework to
a wide range of policies, that take into account all impacts on
individuals and the public. This approach gives a very nice sufficient
statistic in the overall efficiency of a wide range of policies, and
allows \[one to\] easily to compare and combine different policies.
Also, while the approach is marginal, it seems fairly well to \[also\]
allow ... for non-marginal policies (albeit this point would be good to
illustrate and demonstrate more clearly). Besides specific points, one
thing I also wonder is whether the "efficiency" from a social point of
view of policies could also be compared across revenue-generating and
costing policies. For example, consider a MVPF of 1.5 for a subsidy vs.
0.5 for a tax: would these be considered similar in terms of social
efficiency (as they differ similarly from 1 and zero, respectively)? But
maybe using an average MVPF of revenues one would normalize all policies
so they have the same "scale" in that overall efficiency can be measured
on the same side of unity. But this is more of a suggestion or comment.\
\
Finally, while the framework starts out generally across individuals
(and generations) indexed by $i$ \[...\] one issue that I find missing
is the distributional implications or heterogeneity effects. While it is
at some points alluded to (and explicitly when taking the mean of
marginal income or consumption), it would be good to indicate
assumptions (and where relevant, whether this has been considered in the
underlying studies) about distributional incidence. For instance, for EV
subsidies it depends largely if uptake is mostly by rich households
(potentially compared to a representative population), or poorer
households. I don't mean to add this in the analytics but discuss
assumptions and the issue where relevant.

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The clear comparison based on very many causal studies with clear-cut
values is a very strong result, and a clear ranking of climate-oriented
policies with numbers up to 5 domestically is a very strong result.
Also, the positive impact of revenue-generating policies with values
around 0.7.

Also, the measure is very salient and useful for communications and
policy documents.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^5] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

There is some uncertainty, but the important ones are discussed and
shown, so overall of course some uncertainty but would say rather quite
robust.

## **III**. Suggested robustness checks[^6] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

The robustness and importance of key variable\[s\] notably SCC and VSL
are important to highlight and their implications.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^7] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

The findings in my view are immediately very relevant for policy makers
when deciding to implement or abandon given policies. They can give very
simple understandable and sound justification and estimates on the
overall socioeconomic impact of these policies.

## Claims Assessment and Strength of Evidence

The paper makes three main claims that are well-supported by the
evidence presented:

1. Subsidies for investments that directly displace dirty electricity
production (wind PTCs, residential solar) have higher MVPFs than other
subsidies, generally exceeding a value of 2.

2. Nudges to reduce energy consumption have high MVPFs when targeted to
regions with carbon-intensive electricity grids, but much lower MVPFs in
regions with cleaner grids. So here a clear distinction of results based
on the method is found.

3.  Fuel taxes and cap-and-trade policies are highly efficient
revenue-raising mechanisms with MVPFs typically below 0.7.

The evidence supporting these claims is robust to various sensitivity
analyses, including different social costs of carbon, exclusion of
learning-by-doing effects, and alternative approaches to valuing
externalities.

## Methods: Justification and Robustness

The paper extends the MVPF framework in a novel way to assess climate
policies, with particularly innovative handling of learning-by-doing
effects. The methodology is well explained and justified. The authors
are transparent about potential limitations (such as publication bias)
and address these concerns directly.

A key methodological strength is the consistent application of the
framework across diverse policy types, allowing for meaningful
comparison. The paper also provides a convincing demonstration of why
the MVPF approach yields more consistent welfare rankings than
traditional cost-per-ton metrics.

## Suggested Improvements,  Structural Suggestions

1\. **Framework accessibility**: The theoretical exposition in Section 2
could be more accessible to readers unfamiliar with MVPF methodology.
Consider adding a simple numerical example before diving into complex
derivations. And adding how individual differences in particular of
income is typically (based on available estimates of elasticities etc.)
handled.  

The p in R index is still a bit puzzling to me, so that is like a price
or tax variable? In case of nudges etc. \[it\] is less clear. I think
some examples besides the given tax one would be warranted.

In equation (1) also no intertemporal discount rate is given, albeit
weights yes. Yet later on $\rho$ is introduced (and is underlying values
like the VSL or SCC used in $V_t$). Maybe it could be introduced in
general? And for consistency V(t) might be cleaner?

Page 8: "Lagrange multiplier on their budget constraint". Then you
should also introduce the household's problem maybe (if not too
cumbersome).

Equation 2: please introduce B.

Equation 4: please highlight how income difference\[s\] will affect eta
and eta_i (or $\phi_i$). You discuss this around equation (6), but the
group notation is not followed through. I think this section could also
benefit from potentially linking it to this recent paper on a very
similar method in that income and impact values are linked through
income elasticities: (Drupp *et al.*, 2025) [@njdp6bytnjz].

When introducing V, how it accrues to individuals i (and the
intertemporal issue) should be discussed.

The consideration of LbD \[learning by doing\] is very neat, and the
chosen parametrization not unrealistic I would say. One clarification in
the notation/interpretation of how you define the "instantaneous"
$t^\ast$ would be helpful: Is it correct that you are assuming a
one-shot instantaneous subsidy that \[is\] immediately dropped to zero
afterwards? If so, what happens if there would be future subsidies?

2.      **Improved integration of international policies**: Section 7
feels somewhat disconnected from the main US analysis. Either integrate
these findings more thoroughly with the domestic policy discussion or
explain more clearly why the international perspective warrants a
separate section.

3.      **While most text is very clear, sometimes following the cent
values is missing some information**, only very few instances. For
instance, on page 21: "This yields a total welfare cost of \$0.12. When
combined with the damages avoided from gas powered cars, society is
willing to pay \$0.07 for the net global benefit and approximately \$0
for the net local benefit." **Where does the reduction of \$0.05 come
from?**

4.      **Strengthen the conclusion**: The conclusion could better
articulate the policy implications of your findings. How should
policymakers adjust their climate strategy given these results? What
specific policies should receive more focus and investment?

5.      **A small sensitivity analysis for different VSL values** would
be good, just similar you did for SCC, maybe just the most relevant one.

6.      **Clarify non-marginal analysis**: The discussion of
non-marginal policy changes (e.g., for EVs) is important but somewhat
buried. Consider highlighting this aspect more prominently, as it has
significant policy relevance. Page 24 should be a bit expanded \[...\]
how you do the non-marginal integration.

7.      **Nudges and Marketing**: maybe give some information on how
costs are assessed (information campaigns? What are the actual costs
here, would be good to give some ideas).  

8.      **Learning by Doing**: It would be good to discuss the potential
of international spillovers, which are not captured here, but could give
rise to other benefits due to the impact on other countries and vice
versa (similar \[to the discussion\] on international policies for the
environmental externality).

## Minor Issues[^9]

1.  In the abstract, "most effective", here as it is important, would
    not "most cost efficient" be more precise?

2.  Again in terms of wording: "revenue raisers" could be maybe
    explained or put in quotation marks?

3.  Page 2: "international policies" would be good to be \[clarified\],
    like environmental or development policies implemented abroad.

4.  When you refer to the SCC, state what exact unit you use (page 3,
    \$193, say if it is per ton of C or CO2, and deflated to what year.

5.  Page 5: "gains from reduced CO2 37 times larger", please add
    reference, and what SCC was used.

6.  P. 5: Please explain the meaning of "a government cost per ton of
    \$1356.".

7.  Equation (21) contains complex components (DP and DE) that warrant
    more intuitive explanation in the main text.

8.  Some policy categories have very few studies (e.g., cap-and-trade).
    This limitation should be acknowledged more explicitly.

9.  P. 28: Are these Hybrid Electric Vehicles Hybrid or Plugin-Hybrids?

10. Figure 4 contains many data points and could benefit from visual
    simplification or breaking into multiple panels.

11. The discussion of learning-by-doing effects is technical and could
    include more intuitive explanation.

12. Equation 29: introduce "Other"

## Additional Literature to Consider

•        Some recent estimates of distributional implications of in
particular carbon pricing instruments would be interesting to see if
they could also be used and how their findings compare or contrast with
the findings of this very bottom up approach.

•        Literature on non-monetary barriers to energy efficiency
adoption might help explain some of your weatherization findings.

Overall, this is a strong paper that makes a valuable contribution to
the literature on climate policy evaluation. With these relatively minor
revisions, it would be even more impactful and accessible to both
academic and policy audiences. Notably, I believe that these values
could very much help to communicate the relative effectiveness of many
widely discussed policies, and a wide dissemination of the findings
across categories of policies would be very helpful in the international
climate and energy policy discourse.

It is great to see the Github repository. Ideally being able to use it
with freely available software such as R, Octave or similar instead of
Mathematica and Matlab would help to increase the potential
applicability, not sure this is conceptually possible?
