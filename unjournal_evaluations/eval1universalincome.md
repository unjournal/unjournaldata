# Abstract 

*AI generated abstract:* This Unjournal evaluation reviews a very large,
policy‑relevant RCT in rural Kenya that tests three ways to deliver
equivalent unconditional cash: a one‑time \$3,000 lump sum; a \$3,000
two‑year "UBI"; and a two‑year transfer with a promise of ten additional
years (\~\$15,000) of payments. At \~23,000 treated adults and an
estimated \~\$70M program cost, the evaluator judges the study
exceptionally rigorous and useful for governments and NGOs. Core
takeaways: no clear reduction in labor supply or increase in
"temptation" spending; no compelling evidence of village‑level price
inflation (estimates are imprecise); and economic gains from the lump
sum are similar to, and sometimes larger than, those from the long‑term
UBI---consistent with severe credit constraints that ongoing small
transfers do not relax. The report praises design clarity (including a
pre‑analysis plan) but critiques result presentation, recommending a
compact cross‑arm summary table and an explicit comparison of
(income+asset) gains to transfer costs for policymakers.

# Written report

This is an extremely impressive (and costly) RCT that will likely be of
use to policymakers when designing the structure of benefits.

This study uses a RCT to evaluate three different timings of the same
amount of unconditional cash transfer. In one arm, the full amount was
transferred as a lump sum; in another, the amount was transferred as a
UBI over two years, and in the third, the same amount was transferred
over a two-year period, but with the promise of ten years of additional
(similarly valuable) transfers. Each participant received \$3,000 in
transfers over the study period (with the long-term arm expecting to
receive an additional \$15,000 over the duration of the study). The
study seeks to evaluate how the timing of transfers affects the results
of the transfers - for instance, if the promise of a UBI makes
recipients less likely to work because they can rely on future
transfers, or if a lump sum allows for costly upfront investments in
productive assets.

The size of the RCT (and cost of the entire program) bears some
emphasis; there are some 23,000 treated adults (pg. 11); the cost of
this RCT was somewhere in the neighborhood of \$70 million USD. As such,
it likely seeks to inform governments about policymaking, since it is
more similar to scale to a government program than a standard economics
RCT. If a government seeks to do UCTs - as indeed, many governments did
during the pandemic, and continue to explore beyond the pandemic - it is
important to understand how the structure of transfers will impact their
results. It will also inform GiveDirectly, a NGO that provides UCTs as
it continues to scale up its giving. (GiveDirectly moved approx. \$30
million a year before the pandemic; they now move closer to \$200
million a year, and continue to refine their model to best support those
in extreme poverty.)

One can also imagine it being influential even when considering targeted
benefits. Cash benefits can be structured as a one-time transfer, or can
pay out over time; since this study shows that people in extreme poverty
had larger income gains from receiving a single large transfer, one
could imagine governments shifting towards one-time payments rather
paying out a benefit over time.

The RCT itself is well done. The analysis is clear; there is a
pre-analysis plan that is linked to in the text. The design itself makes
a great deal of sense; these are important questions and it seems useful
to have a well-powered RCT seek to answer them.

Since every adult in a village receives a transfer, one can examine
general equilibrium effects; for instance, the authors seek to answer if
prices are higher in villages where everyone is somewhat better off than
in control villages. (They do not find that they are, though they note
that they are simply not rejecting the null; this is not a precise
zero.)

There are some familiar results here, likely expected to any reader
familiar with the cash transfer literature. There is no evidence that
people work less if provided with a UBI (though it is not clear to me
that this would be true in a case where the UBI was large enough to
cover all basic needs), nor do people particularly use UCTs for
temptation goods.

There are also less familiar results. They find that the economic
effects of the lump sum transfer are similar in size (and for some
outcome variables, larger) to that of the long-term UBI - even though
the lump sum transfer recipients have received all that they will have,
the long-term UBI recipients have the security of 10 more years of
transfers. This, to \[me\], suggests that recipients are extremely
credit-constrained - and that this is not alleviated by the UBI. Even
when they receive a UBI, this does not allow them to make the lumpy
investments needed for long-term returns.

Given the size of the study, and the stature of the authors, I do not
feel I need (or indeed, am qualified to give) advice to the authors on
how they might place in a top economics journal. I suspect the paper
will publish well; fewer other RCTs on UCTs have this sample size and
are able to truly answer questions about implementation.

If I were to quibble with this study, it would be on the presentation of
results. There are many outcome variables here, and three different
arms; I found it difficult to follow which results belonged to which
arm. It was difficult to keep them all straight. I would have much
appreciated a summary table comparing the size of results (and also
noting if it was possible to reject the hypothesis that the effect sizes
were the same). Ideally, such a table would group types of outcome (e.g.
consumption, assets, "softer" measures) and perhaps even be color-coded
with relative effect size.

Similarly, the introduction brings up a policy-relevant question that
the paper does not address. On page one of the paper, the authors
mention that "one could ask whether the transfer raises the incomes of
the recipients by at least as much as the amount of the transfer". While
it is possible to calculate if this is true from the results in the
paper (e.g. from income and asset changes), this summary is not
presented in the paper. I think it would be particularly helpful for
policymakers to directly compare the (income + asset) changes to the
cost of the UCT. Policymakers - especially in developing countries -
operate under significant constraints; this would likely help them
better evaluate (expensive) UCT programs in comparison to other
programs.
