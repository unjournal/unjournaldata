# Abstract 

This is an excellent, thorough, and well-written paper on an important
topic of urban greenery and health. The methodology builds on
well-established methods and is convincing with ample placebo and
robustness checks. The authors could further improve policy impact by
expanding on the external validity of these findings by describing,
exploring, and empirically characterizing the setting and MMP further:
what contributes to its success, what greenery is used, and how is the
greenery planted?

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

Urban tree planting provides net health benefits by reducing air
pollution (4.2%) despite meaningful increases in pollen exposure (7.4%).
Overall, the health value of Beijing's Million Mu Project (55 billion
CNY over the past decade) will likely exceed its cost (75 billion CNY)
in the next decade. This is important due to the popularity of urban
greening in the face of climate change and urbanization. The empirical
evidence on pollen exposure and its comparison to air pollution is
especially novel.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above? {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

I am quite convinced by the claim as I found the research framework and
empirical strategy convincing, with ample robustness and placebo checks
(outside vs. inside MMP areas, upwind vs. downwind, etc.).

# Written report

This paper investigates the relationship between urban afforestation and
human health effects through two channels: particulate matter pollution
and pollen concentration. The authors use a large-scale urban greening
effort in Beijing, China along with remote-sensing derived confirmation
of tree-planting, in-situ (as well as remote-sensing) measures of
PM~2.5~ and pollen, and a research design exploiting wind direction. The
paper shows that the substantial greening of Beijing lead to
improvements in air quality, but increases in pollen exposure, which
lead to emergency room visits. While the health costs associated with
these pollen-related ER visits are meaningful, they are less severe than
those associated with air pollution. The authors therefore find sizable
net health benefits of Beijing's Million Mu urban afforestation program.

The paper is on an important topic of the effects of afforestation in
cities, which is of increasing significance in the face of climate
change and urbanization. **The most important and impactful claim of the
paper is that urban tree planting provides net health benefits through
reducing air pollution, despite meaningful increases in pollen
exposure.** The empirical evidence on pollen exposure and its comparison
to air pollution is especially novel. I found the research framework and
empirical strategy convincing, with ample robustness and placebo checks
(outside vs. inside MMP areas, upwind vs. downwind, etc.) that further
strengthened the paper. I only have minor comments on the data,
methodology, and results, explained in more detail below. The findings
of the paper will be of interest to policymakers around the world given
the widespread appeal of "green cities". As such, the paper would
benefit from the authors expanding on the external validity of the
findings from Beijing, discussing both what makes this program
successful (urban forests vs. trees) and how the findings might
translate to different context (with different background PM~2.5~
concentrations and pollen allergy rates). I elaborate on these points
below. Finally, this is already almost in the paper, but it might be
nice to state the payback period of the program explicitly for
practitioners.

## Major Comments:[^5]

1.  **What makes an "urban forest" and to what extent are the results
    specific to Beijing?** The first major comment I have is related to
    the external validity of the findings, considering the
    characteristics of the MMP. The authors convincingly document that
    the greening of the city is a result of the MMP and discuss the
    background and financing of the project. However, there isn't much
    on empirically characterizing the greening (beyond that it's in the
    MMP areas), discussion of the types of trees planted, or what
    greening may have worked best. I think the following would be
    helpful for policymakers and for understanding the external validity
    of the findings:\

    1.  **\[Types of trees/vegetation\] **Page 9 has a nice description
        of the spatial layout of the planned MMP. Besides the spatial
        layout, is there any information on what type of trees or
        vegetation was planted? Were these saplings or more mature
        trees; native/well-adapted to Beijing?\

    2.  **How concentrated/clustered is the observed greening?** Is this
        important for the results? One might imagine that for some of
        the findings (both related to air pollution and maybe especially
        pollen exposure), it matters whether there are new urban
        "forests" or scattered greening. If so, this would certainly be
        important for urban planners to understand. I wonder if the
        authors could explore some measures of upwind greening that
        takes this into account (as opposed to an average)?\

    3.  **Is the change in NDVI capturing certain types of vegetation
        grow**th? For example, another vegetation metric (EVI) is more
        sensitive to dense vegetation. To be clear, I think a change in
        NDVI here is a great metric to look at greening in this setting,
        I'm just wondering if the authors have thought about what type
        of changes is this most likely to capture (extensive vs.
        intensive margin) and how that may relate to the points above.\

2.  \[**Background levels\] **Another question related to external
    validity has to do with the background PM~2.5~ and pollen levels.
    This is especially important for policymakers thinking about costs
    and benefits of urban afforestation programs. While the authors have
    a very helpful discussion about the effect sizes (Section 6.3), I
    was wondering whether they could do more to discuss background
    pollen levels and allergies. For example, are there large
    differences in pollen sensitivity between geographies?

## Minor Comments and Other Suggestions:

1.  Why are 95% confidence intervals not shown for the pre-MMP estimates
    in Figure 3? My guess is that they are noisy so they distract from
    the figure, but it would be helpful to see regardless (perhaps in an
    Appendix Figure).\

2.  Based on Figure 5, PM~2.5~ "sticks around" for longer (the upwind
    shock from a day before still impacts air pollution) vs. pollen
    doesn't. Does this make sense (given science literature, etc.)?\

3.  I noticed that while pollution data is available for 35 stations for
    2014-2019, pollen count data is only for 12 monitors for 2013-2016.
    This is not an issue, but I wonder if it may make sense to discuss
    briefly what the differences may be (and maybe a robustness check
    with a set of close-by pollution/pollen pairs). For example, I
    noticed in Figure 4, part a) that there aren't many pollen monitors
    in the city center.\

\[Other minor comments in footnote: [^6] \].

Thank you again for this wonderful paper!

    most important and impactful factual claim this research makes --
    e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain

    -   Very minor: It might be helpful to define in a footnote in the
        second paragraph of the introduction what *mu* is, for those who
        are unfamiliar with this unit of measurement.

    -   Very minor: I found it a tiny bit confusing that in Figure 1,
        the -0.01 to 0 and 0 to 0.01 colors were both in some very light
        green (suggesting greening). Maybe a more neutral yellow could
        be better.

    -   Very minor: The NDVI labels/coloring could appear again on
        Figure 4, part b).
