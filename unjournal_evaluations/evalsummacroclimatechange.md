# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"The Macroeconomic Impact of
Climate Change: Global vs. Local Temperature\"[@nxx79zip5j4]. The paper
offers a new approach to estimating the damages of climate change, and
their results suggest a substantially higher social cost of carbon. The
evaluators are highly positive about nearly all aspects of this work,
while offering concrete suggestions for further improvement. To read
these evaluations, please see the links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

If I were reviewing this manuscript for an economics journal, I would
recommend revise and resubmit, with only minor revisions. Overall, the
manuscript is well written in the sense that, since the reader
understands immediately what is being estimated and why, that they could
be lulled into the trap of thinking that the research is \"obvious.\"
The final line before the conclusion is \"We conclude that climate
change poses a substantial threat to the world economy.\" But it is the
careful empirical construction of the argument, and the identification
that a literature has been mechanically missing (netting out) the effect
of global temperature shocks while focussing exclusively on local
temperature shocks, that gives this manuscript its evident worth. \
\
The manuscript consists of two parts. First, a reduced form impact of
global temperature shocks on economic activity at the world and country
level. Second, a structural model to convert those estimates into
welfare losses and a valuation of the social cost of carbon. The first
is the \"heart\" of the paper in my estimation, while the second half is
where many articles stop short - the \"so what.\"

## Anonymous evaluator 2

The paper's empirical innovation is simple: estimating the impacts of
temperature on GDP using global time-series data, implicitly capturing
the relationship between global temperatures, extreme events, and GDP
without modelling all intermediate pathways. This idea, combined with
their rigorous analytic approach, may have far-reaching implications due
to the huge magnitude of the resulting estimates. \
\
Given the small sample size used to estimate their main results (N\<60),
robustness checks and cautious inference are essential. I recommend
additional checks, which may increase their uncertainty estimates, and
could result in either higher or lower estimated impacts.

# Evaluation manager's discussion (Ben Balmford)

This paper represents a step-change in how the damages of climate change
are estimated empirically. Rather than relying solely on *local
*temperature shocks, this paper is able to determine the negative
consequences of *global *temperature shocks, which drastically increases
the estimated Social Cost of Carbon. From a policy perspective, this
implies that measures to mitigate climate change are even more likely to
be welfare-enhancing and are more urgently needed.

Both evaluators provide extremely positive reports on the quality and
likely impact of the paper. It clearly makes a very large and important
contribution to the literature. The evaluators propose  ways to enhance
the paper's impact with relatively small changes. 

In addition to these revisions to the main paper,  I'd suggest the
authors also write a synopsis for laypeople -- explaining in simple
terms the advances the paper makes  and the key results it offers that
should influence future policy. 

Both evaluations, particularly the second, offer numerous -- but very
do-able -- changes which would further enhance the academic quality of
what is already a very impressive paper. Finally, in terms of
replicability/open science, while evaluator 2 rightly recognises that
having a replication package available pre-publication is very good (and
unusual), evaluator 1's remark regarding its completeness is correct.

# Process notes

The authors were offered the opportunity to respond to these
evaluations, but they declined.

[^5]: A careful capstone or next step for a mature and important
    literature

[^6]: Possibly hugely influential, as long as the findings are robust. I
    think they are likely to be robust, but that some more checks are
    necessary

    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches

[^9]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^10]: The better assessment of a social cost of carbon is a first-order
    problem for humanity, with strong down-stream effects through the
    policy process.

[^11]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to
    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^13]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable and appropriate? Are the
    results likely to be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the
    authors avoided bias and questionable research practices?

[^14]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^15]: The concepts are clearly defined and reasoning is first-rate. The
    nature of the evidence is detailed, for a sophisticated reader
    perfectly explained.

[^16]: Very clearly written

[^17]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^18]: The current replication is incomplete, does not cover all of the
    analysis (e.g. no panel estimations), and is far from comprehensive.
    Hopefully the authors offer a full replication package in time.

[^19]: Data sets are all public and clearly described. Replication code
    for the key results has been made public on Github ahead of
    publication, which is great and very transparent.

[^20]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^21]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^22]: Extremely relevant to practitioners. Some more context on some of
    the results is warranted, especially around what the results don't
    capture (e.g.adaptation, possibility of technological change,
    climate tipping points, and non-market damages), since this paper
    could be quite influential for policymakers.

[^23]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?
