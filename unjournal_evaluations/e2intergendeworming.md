# Abstract 

This is a highly credible and important analysis of the
intergenerational effects of a Kenyan deworming intervention. Such
effects are important to document because they could meaningfully affect
the cost-benefit analysis of such programs and also teach us about the
mechanisms through which parents transmit advantage to their children.
However, the analysis would be more credible if the authors were
transparent about their deviations from the pre-analysis plan, which
include the addition of (and exclusion of) outcomes and changes to the
empirical specification. Also, more information on the "first
stage"---the impact of randomization on receipt of deworming
treatment---would be helpful.

# Claim identification and assessment[^4] 

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^5] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The primary claim is that exposure to additional years of deworming
treatment in primary school results in lower child mortality of the
children of those exposed. The evidence provided is from analysis of an
intervention randomized at the school level that compares the mortality
of the children of those exposed earlier vs later via the intervention.
The outcome data is derived from long-term follow up survey data of
these experiment participants. I discuss the importance of this claim in
detail in my report.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^6] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

I believe with fairly high certainty the general claim that mortality of
the children of those randomly exposed to the intervention fell and
believe it likely falls within the confidence intervals implied by the
standard errors reported in the paper. However, some uncertainty may
remain due to the fact that not all sampled participants completed the
follow-up surveys.

# Written report

This manuscript examines the intergenerational consequences of a public
health deworming intervention conducted at the school level at 75
schools in Kenya between 1998 and 2001 called the Primary School
Deworming Project (PSDP). The PSDP gave free de-worming drugs to an
essentially randomly-selected 50 of the 75 schools earlier (in 1998 and
1999), with the remaining 25 receiving them later (in 2001). As a
result, the 50 early schools received more years of the deworming
intervention than the later treated schools.

The authors take advantage of this intervention to investigate whether
the beneficial effects of de-worming for the parents' generation result
in better health for their children. To measure these intergenerational
effects, the authors use high-quality panel data collected via the Kenya
Life Panel Survey (KLPS). The primary outcomes they consider are infant
mortality and under age 5 mortality. The analysis shows that the
children of parents induced to receive more years of deworming
medication had children with significantly lower mortality rates. Lower
mortality rates were observed both for the children of female parents
and male parents. This result is surprising as we might hypothesize
different mechanisms through which a mother versus a father might confer
intergenerational health advantages.

The analysis then explores potential mechanisms for this reduced infant
mortality, including measures of parental health, education, living
situation, fertility, and health care, and finds some evidence that all
of these may have moved, suggesting that the portfolio of improved
outcomes resulting from the deworming program may be responsible for the
improved child mortality outcomes observed.

This is a terrific paper documenting important results. The results are
highly credible given the randomized design. The two most important
implications are: first, that these de-worming interventions could have
higher returns than previously believed, because the benefits extend
across generations. Second, it is well known that higher socio-economic
status parents tend to confer this advantage to their children. It is
also well-documented that early life health is predictive of adult
health, educational attainment, and earnings. So, these results suggest
that health may be an important channel driving the intergenerational
transmission of advantage.

I had one major comment regarding the paper and a few minor points,
which I make below.

## Major comment \[Deviations from pre-specified analysis\]

Deviations from pre-specified analysis.** ** High-quality experiments
typically publicly pre-specify their analysis plans in order to avoid
the appearance of searching across specifications and outcomes for
significant effects and selectively reporting those estimates. However,
over time, researchers may change their opinion about the best way to
approach a topic or the appropriate emphasis to place on certain
estimates versus others. Researchers are, naturally, free to deviate
from or amend pre-specified analysis plans over the course of their
investigation. However, it is appropriate, when doing so, to make note
of meaningful deviations somewhere in the manuscript, ideally with an
explanation for why these deviations occurred.

This paper cites AEA-registered plan
[AEARCTR-0001191](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/1191 "null")
as its pre-analysis plan (PAP). I read these analysis plan documents and
noted several meaningful differences between this paper and the
pre-specified analysis. The most meaningful deviations I noticed were:

1.  Second generation child health outcomes were pre-registered as
    "secondary" outcomes related to a primary analysis of participants'
    fertility rather than focal outcomes themselves. Only under 5
    mortality, and not infant mortality, was included as a possible
    outcome in the PAP. The first child health outcome listed in the PAP
    is the "child health index," described as "mean-effects index based
    on the respondent-reported subjective health of their child, and a
    reverse-coded sum of indicators for common health symptoms children
    can experience." But, this child health index does not appear in the
    paper.\

2.  The PAP proposes a secondary hypothesis test that uses an F test to
    examine the joint significance of the original de-worming treatment
    and the cost-sharing treatment but I did not see this in the paper.
    In addition, the PAP states that the authors will report multiple
    hypothesis adjusted p-values, but the manuscript does not contain
    them.

## Minor comments

The authors do not present formal statistics on the "first
stage"\--i.e., how much more likely were participants who attended a
group 1 or group 2 school to receive any de-worming medication compared
to those who attended a group 3 school, and how many more years of
de-worming medication did they actually receive. The paper states that
group 1 and group 2 schools received "on average" 2.41 additional years
of exposure to the PSDP, but take-up was about 75%, with some amount of
treatment reaching the control group. So, we might think \[...\] the
number of additional medication years was lower, perhaps closer to 1.7
or 1.8 years. It's also likely the difference in the likelihood of
receiving any de-worming treatment during these adolescent years is
small between the two groups. More formal analysis on this would be
helpful in interpreting the magnitude of the reduced form differences in
child health outcomes across the treatment and control groups.

Table A1, documenting the low attrition rates of the KLPS survey waves,
is very impressive. Very few studies are able to achieve such a high
follow-up rate over such a long period. One additional helpful piece of
information would be to show differences in baseline characteristics
across respondents and non-respondents by treatment arm.

In a footnote, the manuscript mentions that marriage quality may be a
mechanism, and is an area for future research. Given that the results
show that both mother's and father's health is equally important in
generating intergenerational health benefits, this seems like a relevant
outcome to consider for this paper. E.g., if fathers exposed to the
deworming program matched with healthier mothers, it is possible that
the (untreated) mother's health is the mechanism responsible for the
improvement infant and child mortality outcomes.
