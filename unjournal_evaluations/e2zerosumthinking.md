# Abstract 

The paper introduces zero-sum environments to explain demotivating
beliefs proposing a model and using data from Congo and the World Values
Survey to support the model. It assumes demotivating beliefs to be
universally incorrect, which is unsupported. In contexts with corruption
or instability, hard work may not yield proportional outcomes, therefore
demotivating beliefs may reflect true states of the world, thus negating
the need for their model.

# Written report

The paper explores the evolution of demotivating beliefs, which are
deemed suboptimal from an evolutionary standpoint, by introducing the
concept of zero-sum environments. These environments, where the success
of one individual directly corresponds to the loss of another, can lead
to higher economic payoffs in the short term by reducing competition
among those holding similar beliefs. However, in the long run, such
environments can result in lower innovation and reduced personal and
social welfare. The authors have developed a neat evolutionary model
that is well-written and utilizes data from the Democratic Republic of
Congo and the World Values Survey to validate the model\'s predictions.
However, the model is based on the very strong assumption that
demotivating beliefs are wrong, and alternative interpretations are
possible, which makes the argument and evidence problematic

**First and foremost,** while the introduction of zero-sum environments
to explain the evolution of certain beliefs is an interesting angle, the
assumption that demotivating beliefs are inherently incorrect seems too
strong and unsupported by any evidence provided. In many contexts, these
beliefs are actually accurate reflections of the environment. For
instance, in environments characterized by high corruption or political
instability, hard work may not yield proportional outcomes due to
external factors. you may work hard for a promotion, only to see it go
to a less skilled colleague who is a friend of the boss. Or you may work
hard to grow your business, only for a war to destroy everything. The
world can be unjust and demotivating. The authors do not seem to even
consider this possibility, which I find puzzling. It's important to
recognize that in many parts of the world, and for many people, this is
the rule rather than the exception. The authors cite Benabou and Tirole
extensively, but these scholars focused on the opposite puzzle---how
people can believe in a just world despite evidence to the contrary. If
the authors want to assert that demotivating beliefs are incorrect, they
need to substantiate this claim more thoroughly. Entertaining the
possibility that these beliefs are sometimes accurate diminishes the
need for an evolutionary explanation, as there would then be no
\"evolutionary puzzle\" to solve---beliefs would simply evolve as
correct representations of reality. I suggest the authors consider this
alternative perspective more thoroughly.

**Second,** the measurement of witchcraft beliefs through a question
asking whether individuals believe in gods or spirits other than the
Christian God is problematic. This approach conflates non-Christian
beliefs with witchcraft, which is both inaccurate and misleading. In
addition, beliefs in the evil eyes are mentioned but not measured at
all. The authors should provide more robust evidence to support the
correlation between belief in non-Christian deities and witchcraft.
Without this, the argument risks oversimplifying belief systems, while
presenting the Christian God as the true one.

**Third,** the authors include under the same umbrella of demotivating
beliefs, concepts as diverse as witchcraft, envy, and the notion that
poverty results from factors other than laziness. Their connection is
not clear and leads to controversial conclusions. Particularly,
operationalizing demotivating beliefs through agreement with statements
like \"The poor are poor because they are lazy\" is highly problematic.
Such statements are matters of opinion, rather than objective truth, to
say the least. But by equating disbelief in such statements with belief
in witches (arguably not correct) the authors essentially suggest that
people are poor because they are lazy as an objective truth. The paper's
structure, introducing witchcraft first and then the "poor are lazy"
argument, seems to reinforce this problematic perspective.

**Fourth,** the authors\' choice to dismiss as incorrect the belief that
effort may not always translate into output while simultaneously
accepting the idea that outcomes can be appropriated by others in a
zero-sum environment is puzzling. What makes this distinction
particularly perplexing is that both variables are measured by asking
respondents to state their view of the(ir) world. In one instance, the
authors accept the respondents\' views as accurate, in the sense that
the world is their subjective perception of it and therefore true (e.g.,
\"Gaining happiness requires taking it away from others\" or \"If my
ancestors\' spirits are looking out for my brother, they are less likely
to look out for me\"). However, in the other case, they treat the belief
that \"Hard work doesn't generally bring success---it's more a matter of
luck and connections\" as inherently wrong. This selective acceptance
raises concerns about the consistency of the model's underlying
assumptions. Clarifying this distinction would enhance the robustness of
the model.

**Fifth,** while the authors suggest that the correlation between
zero-sum environments and demotivating beliefs is coincidental, it might
make more sense to explore a causal relationship between the two. For
example, in a zero-sum environment, individuals might put in a lot of
effort only to see their gains diminished by someone else\'s success.
This environment could naturally lead to the formation of demotivating
beliefs, which may, in this case, accurately reflect the effort-outcome
relationship. The evidence presented by the authors, which shows a
correlation between zero-sum environments and demotivating beliefs, is
equally compatible with this causal interpretation. Exploring this
possibility could provide a more nuanced understanding of the
relationship between these variables.

**Finally,** regarding the empirical evidence, I have a few comments:

1.  First and more importantly: Even if the data presents a correlation
    between zero sum and demotivating beliefs, this does not necessarily
    validate the model, as the correlation could align with alternative
    explanations that do not require demotivating beliefs to be
    incorrect.\

2.  The analysis from the Democratic Republic of Congo presents
    individual-level correlations between demotivating beliefs and
    zero-sum beliefs. However, Proposition 4 needs a country-level
    analysis. The authors should test whether the mean demotivating
    belief is higher in populations with greater zero-sum perceptions,
    which could then correlate with lower average effort and material
    welfare. In contrast with the Congo dataset (which, by the way, I do
    not see any particular advantage of using Congo versus any other
    country), the WVS dataset offers an opportunity to explore this at a
    cross-country level but authors choose to correlate zero sum beliefs
    and demotivating beliefs only at the individual level (with country
    fixed effects). Note that going a step further and employing a
    hierarchical analysis could allow testing a potential cross-level
    moderation effect, where zero-sumness moderates the relationship
    between demotivating beliefs and happiness.

3.  The variables used in the Congo study are somewhat "sketchy":\

    -   The first way of validation of the perceptions of zero-sum-ness
        reflecting true zero-sum-ness is slightly unconvincing. The
        survey uses related questions (like the \"banana question\")
        rather than relying on truly revealed preferences, which would
        be more reliable.\

    -   The measurement of witchcraft beliefs is problematic. The
        question equates belief in non-Christian gods and spirits with
        belief in witchcraft, and further equates non-Christian beliefs
        with the notion that effort does not lead to success. This is
        both inaccurate and misleading.\

    -   Regarding the envy question, it measures how much people believe
        in envy, not their beliefs about society (the authors
        acknowledge this).

4.  Regarding the WVS survey variables, the data are robust, and the
    variables are clear. However, I encountered some difficulty
    replicating the exact coefficients, as the manuscript does not
    specify which waves were used. If this information is not already
    provided, it would be helpful if the authors could include it. That
    said, the results are consistent across different waves and control
    variables.

The other part of the evidence, namely the correlation between zero-sum
environments, demotivating beliefs, and both subjective and objective
welfare, can be better explained by assuming that these beliefs reflect
the true state of the environment. The hump-shaped relationship between
zero-sum environments and demotivating beliefs can also hold if we
assume that beliefs are more or less normally distributed around the
true state of the demotivating environment. Finally, the association
between demotivating beliefs and growth via innovation is better
explained by assuming once again that these beliefs mirror a
demotivating environment.
