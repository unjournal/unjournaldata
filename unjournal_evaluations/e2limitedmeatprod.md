# Abstract 

My evaluation focused on assessing the assumptions and providing
up-to-date context and background for the forecasting paper. The paper
(post) was published in 2022, and relied on 2020-2021 data. Since then,
at least eight cultivated meat (CM) products have been approved, claimed
costs are below \$20/kg, CM researchers exceed 250, and total funding
surpassed \$3B, coming from VC, public research funding, and
philanthropic organisations. The CM definition (cell types, species, %
in hybrid products), the media cost components, and other relevant
technologies could be clarified, especially in the context of more novel
findings, to improve further CM forecasts.

# Claim identification and assessment [^5]

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^6] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

D&Z state, \"The aggregated probabilities from our panel include a 54%
probability that less than 100,000 metric tons of cultured meat (where
\>51% of the \'meat\' is produced directly from animal cells) will be
produced and sold at any price in a 12-month period before the end of
2051\"

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^7] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

Struggle to answer as I was assessing the context, not doing the
forecasting exercise myself. Broadly this seems in the right ballpark,
though I think the production would be approaching and would already
reach 100k ton level in the next 10-20 years with a slightly higher
probability (\>50%, \<70% - though again very hard to say as forecasting
here was not my focus.)

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^8] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

Specifically on the production volume, I would consult [this post from
Elliot
Schwartz](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elliot-swartz-19933420_cultivatedmeat-activity-7354897404975796224-CxNq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADm8HHIBvmkelbecyQo8n4uVN6pWS9eG978 "null")
(GFI) estimating current production at 500 metric tons and underlying
sources; I suggested further literature etc. in my evaluation.

# Written report

## Why D&Z post and forecasts are now out of date

My primary concern is that as of August 2025, forecasting by Linch and
Neil has now become out of date: published more than 3 years ago, and
relying on the analysis from sources -- primarily the Humbird TEA --
from 2020-2021 [@nw0gunovz82]. Considering that in turn Humbird relied
on data available at the time of his analysis, presumably coming from
work conducted within a couple of years before that (as there is an
inevitable delay between the most current practices and the published
data), the assumptions and context are now more than 5 years out of
date. For a field that has just emerged and is developing rapidly, 5-7
years makes a huge difference.

**Approved products**

For instance, even in 2022 there was only one CM product approved and
available, in one country in the world -- Eat Just/GOOD Meat chicken
nuggets in Singapore. In 2023, there have been a series of regulatory
approvals and proof-of-concept restaurant launches in US, and currently
to my knowledge there are 8 companies/products approved in US, UK, and
Asia-Pacific, with more companies having already filed for approval too.
I provided a summary of these under "Resources/Literature" \[see
appendix\].

**Media and production costs**

The production volume -- the key metric in this forecast -- is obviously
linked to cost. The forecasts particularly rely on data and assumptions
from the Humbird TEA. There have been multiple approaches taken to
reduce media cost, both the cost of individual components (e.g. use of
plant, algal and yeast hydrolysates instead of purified amino acids) as
well as the development of other technologies that indirectly but
significantly decrease the cost of required media -- e.g. cell line
engineering (used to reduce reliance of cells on growth factors) and
media recycling. Some of these approaches are mentioned in the post, and
some aren't, but they are already being used by the companies mentioned
above developing and gaining approval for their products, as well as in
R&D by researchers. For up-to-date review and references on these see
Quek et al 2024 [@nrfpte96eiq], Leber et al 2025 [@nwyoor6bsw9], and
GFI's Schwartz analysis 2023 [@nhyxte9xjyd](all linked in my suggested
literature list). \[See appendix.\]

In their "what would change our probabilities", Linch says prices below
\$100 per kg. The latest claims from the companies are \<\$20 per kg
([Aleph Farms latest
TEA](https://aleph-farms.com/journals/cultivated-beef-tea-profitability/ "null")
[@nj8kc860352];[ Patsika et al
2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01022-w "null")
[@nxtz9nx1csw] linked to Believer Meats). Admittedly, these are claims
from companies with a clear COI and not all data is publicly released.
owever, many companies are reporting similar numbers, and it shows the
progress has already possibly been quicker than the forecasters have
estimated and \[quicker than what\] the data they relied on suggested.

**Number of researchers**

Beyond production volume and cost, in the summary the authors state:

"Engineering new types of bioreactors, building out supply chains of key
ingredients, securing broad political support for public funding, and
establishing a pipeline of researchers seem promising ways to nudge
production trajectories upwards over a timeframe of a century, not
decades."

I think the developments in the last 5 years have already shown this
statement is at least partially incorrect in its timeline assessment. I
focus on the number of researchers and funding in particular here.

For the number of researchers, their cutoff was \>250 researchers by
2036 but already in 2025 I think we have long surpassed it. Even in
their post, they say GFI lists 60 researchers as of 2022 -- however
these are mostly principal investigators, so the actual number of active
researchers  would have been higher even at the time, including PhD
students and postdocs. Besides, every CM company will have a team of
scientists, ranging say from 5 to 30, working on CM R&D, and some of
them are publishing their work openly too. For instance, the
International Scientific Conference for Cultivated Meat (ISCCM) -- the
longest-running and most science-focused conference of the field -- has
around 300 delegates annually (cited[ in LinkedIn
post](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-scientific-conference-cultured-meat-maastricht/posts/?feedView=all "null"),
by[ event managers](https://www.klinkhamergroup.com/isccm2025/ "null"),
and seen[ on the
photos](https://culturedmeatconference.com/previous-editions/ "null")),
and this is mostly just limited to Europe. The UK alone has more than 20
universities where at least one group is working on CM ([UK Universities
--- Cell Ag UK](https://cellag.uk/uk-universities "null")), and about
the same number of CM companies. As of August/September 2025, GFI's
ecosystem map lists 220 researchers (mostly PIs-only), 169 companies and
6 research centres worldwide working specifically on CM ([Alternative
protein type: Cultivated - The alternative protein ecosystem \|
GFI](https://ecosystem.gfi.org/protein-category/cultivated/ "null"))

**Funding**

In the last three years there has been a downturn of VC funding going to
CM, linked both to the "hype cycle" and the overall biotech investment
downturn and macroeconomic factors. Even taking that into account, GFI
reports \$54M and \$46M rounds raised by CM companies in 2024, with
total CM funding to date surpassing \$3B ([2024 State of the Industry:
Cultivated meat, seafood, and ingredients \|
GFI](https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-State-of-the-Industry-Cultivated-meat-seafood-and-ingredients-GFI.pdf "null"))
-- again, already providing some "social proof" evidence Linch was
looking for in the "what would change our probabilities".

Importantly, public funding, especially in the UK and Europe, has been
increasing significantly over the last few years. The Netherlands
invested \$65M into cellular agriculture primarily focusing on CM
(although cellular agriculture also includes precision f ermentation) - 
[Netherlands to make biggest ever public investment in cellular
agriculture - GFI
Europe](https://gfieurope.org/blog/netherlands-to-make-biggest-ever-public-investment-in-cellular-agriculture/ "null").
The main UK public funding body, UKRI, has awarded £12M to a cellular
agriculture hub, plus about £30M more to two other hubs focusing more
widely on alternative proteins including CM ([Alternative Protein Hubs
--- Cell Ag UK](https://cellag.uk/alternative-protein-hubs "null")).

Finally, big philanthropic funding has also become available. Apart from
GFI and New Harvest grants awarded to specific areas thanks to the
non-profits' donors, Bezos Earth Fund has committed major sums towards
sustainable protein research hubs. Three have been established (in the
US, Singapore and the UK), with total funding of \$100M so far ([Bezos
Earth Fund Grant Creates Sustainable Protein... \| Bezos Earth
Fund](https://www.bezosearthfund.org/news-and-insights/bezos-earth-fund-grant-creates-sustainable-protein-research-hub-at-nc-state-university "null")). 

## Things that could have been done better \[provided in order\] to help make future synthesis and forecasting exercises better

**Cell type and species**

Neil & Linch have focused on beef (their questions refer to "cow cells")
and they don't define cell type very specifically, I assume they mostly
meant bovine muscle cells. This is understandable as this cell type has
been the focus for much of the early CM research, including the first CM
burger by Mark Post in 2013. However, there is now[^9] a lot of interest
in various types of CM: cells from different species (incl. pigs,
chicken, duck and various fish species), as well as different tissue
types (muscle, fat, connective tissue). I think for future forecasts CM
type should be better-defined, as both the species and the tissue type
influence the media requirement -- and therefore the cost -- to a great
extent ([O'Neill et al
2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-022-00157-z "null")
[@n5h3pcpgxpq],[ Leber et al
2025](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5310265 "null")
[@nddnzc659hj])   

**Proportion of CM in the product**

Neil & Linch choose cultivated meat to be defined as 51%+ cultivated.
Indeed it matters a lot as hybrid products are the obvious first step
towards fully CM products, and in many cases considered to be a "final
product" too, with evidence that even a smaller portion of CM in a
plant-based product can have a big impact (e.g.[ Alam et al
2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10789553/ "null")
[@nj1zxqk2p8e]). So I think the best approach for predictions would be
to focus on the cost/total production volume of the CM portion of the
final product, which can vary depending on the product.[^10]\

**Diversifying reference materials and including cell biology and
bioprocessing expertise**

The authors admit themselves that they relied primarily on one source --
the Humbird TEA -- with the addition of a couple other papers. I have
compiled a list of literature (see relevant tab) that would hopefully
provide other and more recent sources to facilitate future forecasts.
Aside from peer-reviewed publications and regulatory dossiers + patents
available that have already been submitted for product approval, GFI
releases information regularly, including their state of industry
reports and reports focusing on specific topics such as media
ingredients.

The authors also admit they do not have background in the field, neither
CM-specific nor wider cell biology or other relevant technical
expertise. Their chosen forecasters -- apart from one -- do not have
that background either. For someone who has worked with mammalian cells
and cell media, it appears that the authors do not have clear
understanding of cell media components, which they also know and state
"We incorrectly included recombinant proteins in the question wording
and transferrin and insulin in the reference material for the amino acid
question. As these are unrelated and more expensive, it is possible this
biased forecasters' estimates. None of the forecasters seemed to notice
this error in their reasoning."  They make further incorrect statements
on growth factors, such as: "(growth factors are various hormones,
cytokines, vitamins, and some other proteins that promote cell growth)".
Such a definition indeed can be found on Google, however in cell biology
it is normally only protein signalling molecules, especially those
affecting cell proliferation, that are classified as growth factors,
certainly not vitamins and in most current literature not other
cytokines either (see[
wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_factor "null") article for
quick review). Therefore for any further forecasts and synthesis I would
strongly recommend further consultations with relevant experts, both in
the CM field and in adjacent fields (wider cell biology and bioprocess
engineering backgrounds).

## Current CM chicken technology

-   Believer Meats (formerly Future Meat; Israel/USA): uses a patented
    spontaneously immortalized chick embryo fibroblast

-   Upside Foods (USA): uses a patented engineered chicken skeletal
    muscle cell line with both overexpression of telomerase and gene
    knock-out

-   GOOD Meat (Singapore/USA): uses cells isolated from chicken embryo

**From William's review:**\
"Avian species also have an advantage in cell line development research
because cells can easily be extracted from their embryos (eggs), with
chick embryos employed as a common model of developmental research. This
is demonstrated with the DF-1 cell line used by GOOD Meat (9) which was
isolated from a chicken embryo. Another example is the FMT-SCF-4 and
CEF-4 cell lines used by Pasitka et al. 2022 when cultured in suspension
in bioreactors (53) . These fibroblast cell lines were found to
demonstrate cost effective cultivated chicken production at a price of
US \$6.2 per pound (6). Both cell lines are fibroblasts, that require
low-cost media, are readily adaptable to suspension culture and can
undergo spontaneous immortalization (26,54). However, there are
arguments that cultivated meat produced using fibroblasts only doesn't
follow one vision of cultivated meat which is to replicate traditional
meat down to its cellular and molecular level."

"Broiler chickens, for example, are a natural choice for cultivated meat
compared to layer (egg-producing) chicken. This is because the satellite
cells of broiler chicken were found to have higher proliferation rates,
potentially because of selective breeding of rapid muscle cell
proliferation phenotypes, as well as a greater expression ratio of type
II fast-twitch muscle fibres (73)."

# Appendix: further notes from the Evaluator

## Evaluator background/disclaimer

I am a researcher with an academic background (PhD in Cell Biology,
currently working in computational biology at UCL)

-   I have followed the cellular agriculture (cell ag) / cultivated
    meat (CM) space since early 2022, and have been involved in a
    non-profit Cell Ag UK since spring 2022. I am currently a
    co-director of this non-profit and do paid work for it about 1 day a
    week

    -   Cell Ag UK does not have investments or other financial COI;
        it's a small-scale non-profit funded philanthropically, so far
        mostly through EA-aligned animal welfare funders, though not
        exclusively

    -   Cell Ag UK's main remit is community-building within the cell ag
        space, currently focusing on engaging students, early-career
        professionals, academics, and general public. Cell ag includes
        both CM and precision fermentation technologies

    -   I have never worked for a CM company (although I know a lot of
        them and some of the internal workings) and have not worked in
        the field academically either (no publications etc)

-   I have engaged with EA content 20+h, and have been to 2 EA
    conferences, however, I don't consider myself fully part of EA
    community

    -   I am somewhat familiar with the way EA approaches animal welfare
        and alternative proteins, though not familiar with current EA
        funders' priorities. I am much less familiar with forecasting,
        operationalisations etc - I understand these terms intuitively
        but have not "applied" them in EA context before .

## Why focus on cultivated meat rather than fermentation-based egg products 

*David Reinstein: *[*This EA
Forum*](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CA8a9JS3fYb63YWoh/the-humane-league-needs-your-money-more-than-alt-proteins "null")*
post made the case that fermentation-based egg products might be the
most promising, might be particularly promising, causing me to
reconsider our focus on cultured meat somewhat. Estere provided an
interesting counterpoint.*

Seinkemane: CM is the closest we can get to real meat which avoids the
problem of convincing people of many other things, so I think we need
CM, and therefore this PQ makes sense.

*Reinstein: Maybe you\'re suggesting that CM could be a leading example
that would convince people that this is possible and worth pursuing?*

Seinkemane: This is a question that we get asked - why even do CM when
you have plant-based, or why do CM and not fermentation. My response is
usually along the lines of: I personally don't actually need CM, I live
in a wealthy Western country, with a good enough salary, and happy on my
vegan diet with sufficient protein and other nutrients from plant and
myco sources. However, I'm in a minority - the demand for meat worldwide
is growing, a lot of it in countries in Asia, notably China, as well as
LMICs. It is people who just recently have been able to afford meat.
Personally I think it's neither feasible nor ethical to meet this demand
with plant-based products. If we can get meat by biotechnology with
same/similar cost to live animal meat, be it fully cultivated or hybrid,
this seems to me the more logical way forward.

As discussed above, cultivated chicken could be a particularly promising
avenue, for both cost and impact. Precision fermentation is great, a
more mature technology too. However I think there's much less R&D on
cultivated egg - outside EA, this wouldn't be considered a priority/not
as much demand as possibly for CM. Cultivated milk is more popular and
maybe more feasible too - it could be done both in mammalian cells
producing whole milk, which wouldn't actually be PF but more a CM-like
process, or producing individual components - such as casein, whey and
milk fats - in microbes (which is PF). But coming back to suffering per
protein produced for consumption, or other metric (environmental/other
welfare/publich helath), I still think CM would have the highest impact
by far.

*DR: I agree that CM it\'s far more relevant than milk for the animal
welfare as well as  the \'animal vector for spreading disease\' issue. 
I\'m not ready to write off precision fermentation as being high(est)
value, but you make a good case to retain some focus on CM.*

    stream", described
    [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2).
    The ratings should not be directly compared to those in our main
    academic stream.

[^2]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^3]: We asked evaluators to rank this paper "heuristically" as a
    percentile "relative to applied and policy research you have read
    aiming at a similar audience, and with similar goals." We requested
    they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to
    future impactful applied research, and practical relevance and
    usefulness."

[^4]: However, for this particular case we de-emphasized the ratings
    aspect. We asked evaluators to focus on (1) whether the claims made
    in the paper were valid and up-to-date and (2) things that the
    authors could have been done better, particularly considering ways
    to future synthesis and forecasting exercises better.

    ###   {#note-applied-and-policy-stream reactroot=""}

[^5]: This comes from the form. If the author didn't do this, please
    skip this section.

[^6]: The evaluator was given the following instructions: Identify the
    most important and impactful factual claim this research makes --
    e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^7]: "Feel free to express this in terms of the probability of the
    claim being true or as a credible interval for the parameter being
    estimated."

[^8]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^9]: Manager: I assume Estere is implying that this was the case even
    in 2021.

[^10]: Manager's note: This is the approach we're taking with The
    Unjournal Pivotal Question, allowing the question of 'what share is
    CM' to be considered separately
