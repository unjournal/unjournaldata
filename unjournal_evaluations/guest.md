Guest Worker Programs: Experimental Evidence from the India-UAE
Migration Corridor". These evaluations can be found below.

Guest Worker Programs: Experimental Evidence from the India-UAE
Migration
Corridor**](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31354/w31354.pdf "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments, in addition to
ratings for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment:**[^1]** **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^2]** **"On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed

# Evaluation summaries

## Evaluator 1 

Evaluator did not give a summary. Below, an AI-generated bullet-point
summary.

-   Praises the research for attempting to estimate important welfare
    impacts of temporary migration

-   Finds the methods clearly justified, reasonable, and potential
    biases discussed

-    Highlights limitation of using friend/family responses for some
    observations, which could introduce measurement error (not discussed
    by authors)

-   Two areas of unclear communication: 1) terms of contract between
    broker and job seeker, 2) whether migration to countries other than
    UAE is considered

-    Suggests exploring heterogeneity by contingent agent fee amount

-    Suggests controlling for caste/religious minority status when
    analyzing social network effects

-   Commends authors for being open about limitations and providing
    replication materials

## Evaluator 2

The key contributions of this paper are its analysis of intermediary
costs of migration, migrant well-being and diversity in the workplace,
expectations of job-seekers and joint comparisons of various pecuniary
and non-pecuniary measures of migration. A major limitation is the lack
of a welfare justification for randomisation and little to no discussion
on equipoise. My suggestions largely revolve around improvements to the
discussion of methodology, representativeness, attrition and
representation of treatment effects.

# Evaluation manager's discussion

This paper serves as a valuable policy discussion on migration in
high-density corridors (such as those between India and the UAE), using
the case of guest worker visas. Overall, the paper offers a closer look
at the non-pecuniary benefits of such programs on workers (e.g., in
terms of subjective well-being), which is a novel area that is difficult
to address. The UAE-India migration corridor also comes with historical
context that the authors find challenging to incorporate in their
analyses. In terms of overall analysis, the extension of the
experimental findings to overall efficiency gains from migration are
also difficult to examine at face value given methodological challenges
that one of the evaluators has raised.

# Unjournal process notes

## Why we chose this paper 

We considered this paper within the context of a set of recent papers
involving migration under our [manager autonomy
track](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PjBGmrvT4PjudHW4F0a0dQ3V5PxcDq7o95xTzmHG4U4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ayka3lybri4b "null"),
with substantial input from others on our team. From the suggester:

> ... The paper claims that receipt of the random offer experienced 30%
> higher earnings, and those who took up the offer to migrate to the UAE
> doubled their compensation. The paper makes a case for liberalised
> immigration system to facilitate international labour migration. It
> has global implications.
