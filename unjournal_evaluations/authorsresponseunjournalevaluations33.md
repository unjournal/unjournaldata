I \[Rosie\] am hugely grateful to the reviewers for their time and
expertise, and agree with many (though not all) of their comments. For
context, these guidelines are not a published paper, but are WIP
internal guidelines that we use at FP to estimate internal and external
validity rankings across different RCTs. I\'m especially pleased that
Unjournal chose to review it, as it is often difficult to get reviews of
this style of work

I unfortunately can\'t engage more at present without dropping on really
high-priority work, but I hope to respond more fully in the next few
months; I am keen to find and test different methods of estimating
effect size inflation and Type S error. I would view it as a hugely
positive thing if the reviewers (or other readers) have uncovered
superior ways of estimating these metrics---especially methods that are
practical for time-pressured decision and policy-makers. I hope that
this prompts more discussion in this area.
