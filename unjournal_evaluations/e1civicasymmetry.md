# Abstract 

This paper uses a randomized experiment among informal firms in Togo to
explore how civic tax information affects compliance and economic
activity. While overall tax participation falls, the intervention leads
to more accurate self-reporting among larger firms and economic
expansion among smaller ones. The findings challenge standard views on
tax education and offer novel insights into state--firm dynamics in
low-capacity settings. With some clarifications, the paper makes a
valuable contribution to the literature.

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

Thus, even though tax participation has decreased, tax revenue likely
increased in the aggregate. Tax information shapes tax behaviour in
complex ways: providing firms with knowledge about their tax obligations
reduces overall tax participation but results in heterogeneous effects,
increasing compliance among larger firms and decreasing it among smaller
firms. This suggests that civic knowledge empowers firms to better
assess their obligations and assert their rights, leading to more
accurate self-declaration rather than uniform increases in compliance.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^5] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

The claim is thought-provoking but the described mechanisms seem
plausible. Potential robustness, and future research can help
disentangling other potential explanations behind the result.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^6] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

A follow-up study conducted in collaboration with the revenue agency and
linking participants to their anonymized tax records would be
compelling.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^7] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

As highlighted in my evaluation, the findings carry important
implications for state capacity and legitimacy. Civic education
initiatives should be tailored to the specific socio-institutional
context, as simply increasing information may not uniformly enhance
compliance. Instead, such interventions can produce more complex
outcomes, potentially fostering a fairer and more legitimate tax system
by deepening firms' understanding and reshaping their interactions with
the state.

# Written report

This paper employs a randomized controlled trial conducted among
informal micro and small enterprises (MIEs) in Lomé, Togo, with the
objective of examining how civic information about tax obligations and
the fiscal contract influences tax participation (extensive margin), tax
compliance measures (intensive margin), and economic activity indicators
(additional secondary margins). The intervention involved training firm
owners about their tax obligations and the purpose of taxation, aiming
to address informational asymmetries that discourage effective tax
compliance and undermine state legitimacy. The study's primary outcomes
focus on the extensive margin of tax compliance -- specifically, whether
firms paid taxes in the last tax season -- and measures of the intensive
margin of compliance -- i.e., elicitations of MIEs' tax liabilities.
Secondary measures include economic activity indicators such as the
level of business expansion.

The empirical findings surprisingly reveal that the intervention led to
a decrease in overall tax participation on average. However, results
from heterogeneity analyses show a more nuanced picture: higher-revenue
firms appear to have increased their tax compliance, while lower-revenue
firms reduced their tax payments. Notably, the latter group also
expanded their economic activities following the intervention. The
authors claim that this result suggests better civic knowledge may have
empowered smaller firms to assert their rights and refuse informal or
informally-approximated tax obligations enforced by tax officials based
on observable assets, leading to more accurate self-reporting of income
and taxation. Additionally, the authors propose that the increase in
economic activity among smaller firms indicates enhanced bargaining
power and a more positive sorting into compliance, which could raise the
overall revenue base despite a decline in participation among some
smaller firms.

The paper situates its contribution within the broader literature on tax
compliance, informational asymmetries, and state legitimacy, especially
in developing country contexts with large informal sectors and limited
state capacity. It emphasizes the complex interplay between civic
knowledge, power dynamics, and tax behaviour, challenging standard
notions that increased information uniformly leads to higher tax
compliance.

Overall, I consider this paper an insightful contribution to the
literature on an important but largely overlooked topic, and I think it
is certainly of general interest for readers in the field of public
economics and particularly in tax mobilization in developing countries.
Nevertheless, I have some comments, questions, and suggestions that may
help clarify some points and lead to an improved version of the paper. I
structure my reasoning by referring to the main claims of the paper,
commenting on their solidity, and providing some suggestions on how to
improve the interpretation of the results.

## Civic information shapes tax behaviour in complex ways.[^8] {#civic-information-shapes-tax-behaviour-in-complex-ways}

Certainly, one of the main claims of the paper is that providing firms
with knowledge about their tax obligations reduces overall tax
participation -- an extensive margin effect -- but results in
heterogeneous effects on the intensive margin, notably increasing
compliance among larger firms and decreasing it among smaller firms.
This, the authors rationalize, suggests that civic knowledge empowers
firms to better assess their obligations and assert their rights,
leading to more accurate self-declaration rather than uniform increases
in compliance.

Therefore, the authors argue, **informational asymmetries can be
reconfigured into productive sorting**. A better understanding of the
fiscal contract enables firms -- especially those with higher revenues
-- to self-declare more accurately based on tax code rules linking
liabilities to profits rather than assets, potentially increasing tax
revenues even if participation declines overall. Conversely, smaller
firms' reduced participation coupled with economic expansion -- the
authors suggest -- indicates that some firms use the knowledge gained to
negotiate or refuse informal and perceived unfair tax obligations --
based on asset estimation by tax officials -- leading to a more
efficient and legitimate tax system.

## Economic activity among smaller firms increases with civic knowledge. {#economic-activity-among-smaller-firms-increases-with-civic-knowledge}

The observed expansion in economic activities among the lower-revenue
group post-intervention is rationalized by the authors as a sign that
civic information can enhance the bargaining power and confidence of
informal firms, allowing them to operate more openly and possibly pay
taxes more voluntarily in the future.

## Implications for state capacity and legitimacy.  {#implications-for-state-capacity-and-legitimacy}

The findings imply that civic education interventions must be carefully
designed and understood within the socio-institutional context -- simply
providing information does not necessarily increase compliance uniformly
but can lead to more nuanced impacts. The authors speculate that this
could potentially lead to a more equitable and legitimate tax system by
improving firms' understanding and their relationship with state
authorities.

While obtaining surprising results, the authors propose a reasonable
rationalization of their findings without overclaiming how firmly
grounded it is, and they also acknowledge other speculative potential
explanations and mechanisms. For instance, they suggest that the
backfiring for small firms might be rooted in a \"bomb-crater effect\"
of audits if firms learned that the audit probability is lower than
expected. Some discussion on the literature exploring the role of
information in shaping tax enforcement effectiveness could be integrated
into the concluding sections (see e.g. Almunia et al. 2022
[@n1q16m2ifqa]; Best et al., 2021 [@n1chhj54fks]; Kotsogiannis et al.,
2024 [@n4jmpcujacm]; Mascagni et al, 2019 [@nqv4fbmp2cj]).

## \[Limitations\][^9]

### \[Lack of administrative data\]

The main limitation of the analysis, in my view, is that the authors do
not have access to tax administrative data linked to the survey
elicitations. As a result, the measures of tax participation and tax
payments are self-reported by the MIEs' owners. The design of the
experiment is well-structured to partly overcome this limitation by
asking owners to provide proof of tax payment through receipts to back
up their declarations. However, this requirement resulted in a
considerable mass of missing values on this outcome variable, which are
imputed as zeros. This can lead to a noisy measure of the treatment
impact on this variable, which the authors appropriately recognize when
interpreting the results. I wonder whether some of the information
elicited in the survey can be used to construct an indirect measure of
liabilities paid by the MIEs, as an alternative outcome variable for
robustness checks. Relatedly, did the enumerators collect information
about how the tax payment was made (through tax collectors or via
voluntary compliance)? This could be an interesting dimension of
heterogeneity to explore, if the data allow.

### \[Sample size and representativeness\]

The sample size of the firms involved in the study may be another
limitation in terms of external validity, both within and beyond the
context of Togo. I suggest that the authors expand the discussion on
this issue -- mentioned briefly in both the introduction and conclusion
-- and elaborate a bit more on how the selected firms are representative
of the typical MIE context in Togo and, more broadly, across developing
countries (or at least in sub-Saharan Africa). This would help clarify
the broader implications of the findings.

### \[MLEs' experience and interactions with tax officials\]

A dimension not sufficiently explored in the study, in my view, is the
role of MIEs' experiences with tax officials. In particular, it is not
clear whether the survey collected detailed information on these
interactions. For example, how frequent are these interactions, and how
are they perceived by the MIEs (as tax audits or something else)? Table
8 presents some interesting suggestive evidence on the intersection
between tax payment and interaction with tax officials across the
treatment cohorts. It would be helpful to understand more about the
nature of these interactions to support the proposed mechanisms
explaining the results. In this regard, a complementary contribution is
offered by Mascagni et al. (2025 [@n075jh4n6cg]), who analyse the impact
of tax education on compliance through a survey experiment linked to
administrative data in Rwanda. There, the authors elicit taxpayers'
perceptions of their interactions with tax officials and show how these
interactions affect compliance. While this may be outside the scope of
the current paper, it would be valuable to reference this work in the
discussion. As the authors note, perhaps the reduction in tax
participation among small firms is related to previous negative
experiences with tax collectors. Relatedly, is there any information on
prior experience with formal tax auditors?

### \[Request: Details of treatment delivery\]

Another aspect that deserves clarification is how the treatment was
delivered. How did the enumerators conduct the knowledge transfer? On
page 11, the authors refer to an information packet and consultation,
but more details on this process would help the reader understand the
intervention better. Also, was the enumerator team relatively
homogeneous, or might there be heterogeneities worth exploring, if this
information was recorded?

### \[Identification strategy; Request: matching as a robustness check\]

Regarding the identification strategy: randomization across the
treatment cohorts produced two groups that are ex-ante balanced based on
observable characteristics (as shown in Table 2) and are expected to be
balanced on unobservables as well. Thus, the authors rely on a simple
comparison of means between the two groups at endline to estimate the
causal treatment effect. As a robustness check, I suggest complementing
this approach with a matching procedure. For example, the authors could
stratify on observable characteristics and then estimate Equation 1
using weights obtained from that stratification. This could be
implemented through Coarsened Exact Matching (see Iacus et al., 2011
[@nhje2b3ff2h]; Iacus et al., 2012 [@n61hf0ke6pf]).

## \[Conclusion\]

In sum, this paper makes a valuable and thought-provoking contribution
to the literature on tax compliance and state-building in low-capacity
settings. By highlighting the nuanced and sometimes counterintuitive
effects of civic information on tax behaviour, it opens up important
avenues for future research and policy design. While some limitations
remain -- particularly regarding measurement and external validity --
the authors are transparent about these challenges and offer plausible
interpretations grounded in the context. With some clarifications and
additional robustness analyses, the paper stands to make a strong and
policy-relevant impact in the field.
