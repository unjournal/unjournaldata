We thank the Unjournal team and the reviewers for the new experience.
Our paper is currently under review, and the Unjournal inputs will
certainly help the paper to be in a better shape when it eventually
appears in a journal! We want to use the space here to add several
comments of our own.

Really this paper has just one core message: econometric measurement of
biodiversity can be done. This applies both to the metrics of
biodiversity itself and to the impacts of various stressors thereon.
First, real biodiversity measurements are at hand. For example, the one
we use in this paper -- the BioTIME data -- is a publicly available
dataset that consolidates hundreds of (longitudinal) ecological studies
since 1960s. Other sources are emerging too. Second, quasi-experimental
designs that were used to study conventional economic outcomes can be
useful to identify biodiversity effects as well. Our paper presents
three quasi-experiments: (1) the Nakamura and Steinsson
([@temp_id_7958491442664837]) military buildup shift-share design to
generate quasi-experimental state level spending; (2) wind directivity
and pollution transport design a la Deryguina et al
([@temp_id_9817885514219926]) and Barwick et al.
([@temp_id_260982192872639]) to get at the causal effect of air
pollution; and (3) county-level environmental regulation variation
resulting from Clean Air Act's outdoor air quality standards. This has
been widely used in the field of environmental economics to study
productivity, environment, health, and amenity impacts of regulation
([@temp_id_3867797865062985] is a famous example).

We hope more economists join the study on causes and effects of
ecosystem health. The coupling between the economy and ecosystems is
becoming increasingly apparent, so it seems part of economists\' job to
illuminate it.
