# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Asymmetry in Civic
Information: An Experiment on Tax Participation among Informal Firms in
Togo" [@nqhkpdv68za]. Both evaluations are generally positive (journal
tier ratings approaching 'top field journal'), and also offer critiques
and suggestions for improvement. Both evaluators provide suggestions for
the interpretation of the results and their implications, request more
detail, especially about the treatment delivery, and express concerns
with sample size and power. Evaluator 1 sees the lack of administrative
data as a key limitation, and suggests ways the authors might do more to
address this. They ask for further consideration of the MLEs' experience
with tax officials, and a specific identification robustness checks
involving matching. Evaluator 2 is concerned about causal
identification, suggesting that using same enumerators at baseline and
endline could violate an exclusion restriction. They also express doubts
about whether the survey measures reflect beliefs about
"accountability", among other concerns. To read these evaluations,
please see the links below.

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

This paper uses a randomized experiment among informal firms in Togo to
explore how civic tax information affects compliance and economic
activity. While overall tax participation falls, the intervention leads
to more accurate self-reporting among larger firms and economic
expansion among smaller ones. The findings challenge standard views on
tax education and offer novel insights into state--firm dynamics in
low-capacity settings. With some clarifications, the paper makes a
valuable contribution to the literature.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

This paper reports an RCT of a taxpayer education campaign in Togo,
showing increased tax knowledge, a shift in the distribution of tax
payments, and higher reported revenues. The \[evaluation\] finds the
study valuable in its focus on small firms and the large tax knowledge
effects. It offers suggestions concerning measurement bias due to
enumerator involvement in the intervention, accountability measures, and
interpretation of payment effects.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

**Author's engagement: **The authors have been helpful and encouraging,
sharing their latest work and discussing the paper\'s status. They have
indicated they intend to respond to these evaluations at some point
further along in the journal publication process. If so, we will post
this response here.

I am planning to wait for this response before discussing the package
further in this section.

(From David Reinstein)

[^1]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have
    encountered in the last three years." We requested they "consider
    all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge
    production, and importance to practice.

[^3]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\

    This was on the newer form only

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: The project offers relevant insights into tax compliance in
    informal sectors, with clear implications for state-building and
    development policy in low-capacity settings.

[^8]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^9]: The methods are clearly explained and appropriate, with a
    well-justified RCT design. Assumptions are reasonable, and the
    authors acknowledge key limitations.

[^10]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^11]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^12]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^13]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus

    benefits, etc.)?"

[^14]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^16]: Journal of Development Economics can be a reasonable prediction

[^17]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^18]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^19]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^20]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\
