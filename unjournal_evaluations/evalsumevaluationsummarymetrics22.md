  We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Accelerating Vaccine
  Innovation for Emerging Infectious Diseases via Parallel Discovery\".
  To read these evaluations, please click the links at the bottom. The
  evaluators generally agree about the importance and promise of this
  work, but also express substantial doubts about its credibility and
  usefulness. (They also make specific suggestions for improvements and
  extensions, as well as requests for clarification.) The evaluation
  manager echoes this, noting that the "limitations of the paper as it
  stands make it far less valuable than it could be."

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments, in addition to
ratings for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment:**[^1]** **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^2]** **"On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null"))"

# Evaluation summaries

## Evaluator 1 : Richard Bruns

This is an advance on the literature, a promising foundation for future
research. In its current form I do not find it convincing as a model of
the future of vaccine development, and I am very skeptical of its
repeated claims that the portfolio will have a 66% chance of preventing
a major 'Disease X' pandemic, because the paper does not provide enough
information about how it simulates the development of these vaccines for
a previously unknown pathogen.

However, it provides some insight in its current form (it shows that
challenge trials, while potentially helpful, are not sufficient to solve
the problem), and there are several minor extensions that could make it
much more useful. In particular, Table S1 should be promoted to the main
body of the paper, discussed more, and expanded. This table tells us
what is more or less likely to make a vaccine portfolio happen, and
should be expanded to include more policy choices, such as reforms to
decrease the cost of trials.

## Evaluator 2: Tim Colbourn

This paper tackles an important global priority area. The main
limitations are the premise being restricted to private sector
investment, and parameter values used. A societal perspective including
(up to 100%) publicly owned efforts, and different reasonable parameter
value assumptions, including optimising number of vaccine candidates in
relation to expected outbreaks and infections, would alter the
conclusions. Calculating cost per QALY gained, and in relation to
current healthcare expenditure, would further strengthen the paper.

# Evaluation manager's discussion (by David Manheim)

The question of how to fund vaccines for novel diseases is critical for
preventing or mitigating future pandemics, and given the current speed
of vaccine development and the relative lack of investment, commercial
approaches for funding seem important. Given that, this paper targets an
important question. That said, it is unclear to me, and the reviewers
\[evaluators\], whether the specific approach is among the most
promising, and the evaluation is of a fairly narrowly defined approach.
At the same time, most of the points investigated to come to the
conclusion seem broadly important to any diversified approach for
pre-development of vaccines.

The reviews \[evaluations\] primarily highlight the limitations, because
the value of the paper\'s investigation overall is obvious. At the same
time, the limitations of the paper as it stands make it far less
valuable than it could be, as the reviews note. For that reason, it is
disappointing that the authors have not yet engaged, because of the room
to so greatly improve the impact of the papers\' investigation.

    to learn how this changed, and to see the earlier instructions.

[^5]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^8]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^9]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^10]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^11]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^12]: The topic is highly relevant as pandemics and infectious diseases
    are a top global priority. The premise with the limited focus on
    private sector investment is somewhat flawed though as per comments
    1-3 of my review, as is the assumption of no attempt to optimise of
    the portfolio of vaccines at the outset (e.g. in relation to
    expected benefits) as per comments 5-6 of my review.
