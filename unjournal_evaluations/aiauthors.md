# **Reply to Unjournal Evaluations of \"Artificial Intelligence and Economic Growth\"**

Philippe Aghion, Benjamin Jones, and Charles I. Jones

February 2023

Thanks to Seth and Phil for their careful, thorough, and generous
reading of our paper. They make many excellent points, and we agree with
them all.

Before commenting on some specifics, we\'ll take this opportunity to
reminisce a bit about the backstory behind this paper. Ajay Agrawal,
Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb organized the inaugural NBER conference on
*The Economics of Artificial Intelligence *([@agrawal2019economics]).
They solicited authors from across the different subfields of economics,
including each of us independently, and put together a phenomenally
broad and interesting set of experts. The three of us had all thought a
bit about the growth consequences of artificial intelligence, but many
of our thoughts were nebulous and not obviously suited to a standard
economics journal. The conference organizers suggested we might work
together, and we quickly agreed. Great fun ensued!

So that\'s part of the explanation as to why, as both reviewers
indicate, the paper reads to a great extent as a bunch of different
ideas and suggestions, rather than a laser-like focus on a single idea
that is worked through thoroughly. We found it intriguing that the
Baumol-like forces that make some essential tasks hard to automate might
constrain the effects of automation. But we also found it fascinating
that it is easier than we had guessed to get explosive growth and
singularities, even without complete automation. Our hope then and now
is that these ideas will stimulate researchers to work on this topic.

And now an important mea culpa: we apologize for the embarrassing number
of typos and for one significant mistake that Phil caught and corrected
(in the proof of the singularity in Example 3 on page 256). We maintain
a \"[corrected
proof](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/AJJ-AIandGrowth.pdf)\" on our web
pages that includes all corrections we\'ve found or received, and we\'ll
continue to do that.

Seth raises many interesting points, especially about what might happen
if the saving rate were endogenized. He is surely right that it would be
interesting to push our work in this direction, and his research on this
topic highlights several insights.

Each of the referees' suggestions (endogenous labor supply, the effect
of automation on politics and growth policy, endogenous savings,
endogenizing the automation of research tasks...) deserves a paper on
its own. And when commenting on Section 5, the referees accurately
stress that the remarks laid out in that section remain speculative and
deserve deeper analyses. Here it may be worth mentioning that each of us
separately are pursuing the "AI-Automation" research agenda in ways that
partly intersect with the referee's comments. For example, Seth puts
forward the idea that AI should lead to more centralization and favor
the emergence of super-star firms. A recent paper entitled "A Theory of
Falling Growth and Rising Rents" ([@temp_id_44967336463460095]) develops
and calibrates a growth model where the IT revolution leads in this
direction. The bottom line is that the effect of IT and AI revolutions
on long-run productivity growth can become negative if competition
policy does not adapt.

As we thought about the topic of artificial intelligence and economic
growth, what stood out most to us is the incredible range of
possibilities. Both evaluations correctly point out that this remains a
wide-open area for more research, both on the theory side and certainly
in terms of using evidence to help convert the possibilities to
probabilities. Thanks again for the excellent and insightful
evaluations.
