# Abstract 

A well-written and coherent paper. One of the first showing
intergenerational effects of childhood health intervention\[s\] in \[a\]
LMIC, including cost-benefit analysis. Statistical power calculation\[s
were\] not provided. Literature review is slightly one-sided. Some
results in tables could be discussed further in \[the\] text. Some
typical outcomes \[were\] not present (nor mentioned), \[... and \] if
\[they\] exist in the data \[it\] would be interesting to see them.

# Summary Measures

# Written report

This paper is using a widely-studied randomized school-based deworming
program in Kenya to explore the presence of intergenerational benefits.
In particular, it looks at infant mortality and under-5 mortality, and
examines five possible channels. The effects are \[a\] 20% reduction in
mortality rate (though only under-5 is significant), with all examined
channels contributing to the reduction. The study also explored
heterogeneous effects by parents' gender and age, with only age being
significant.

This is a very interesting and important paper studying \[the\]
intergenerational effects of early childhood health interventions.
Overall, the paper is well written, focused on a very specific
well-defined hypothesis, which is answered adequately and using
appropriate and well-executed methods. The assumptions in the
cost-benefit analysis seem plausible and the estimated return can indeed
be considered conservative.

Although I found the paper well-written and of high quality, here are
some comments/suggestions the authors might find useful:

1.  There are several studies analysing impacts of deworming mentioned,
    although all on the more 'positive' side. Perhaps some of the more
    'critical' papers could also be cited as contrast to provide a more
    balanced view of the literature. \[*Note: numbering added.*\]

2.  It would be helpful if the authors comment on (or include) something
    on statistical power, currently there is no mention of it.

3.  It would be helpful to the reader if the authors include a table in
    the additional exhibits (for online publication) with summary
    statistics for the covariates discussed in page 6.

4.  For the channels analysis in Table 2: The number of observations
    changes for each outcome. Are results robust to keeping the same
    observations across all specifications?

5.  Dose-response interpretation: Although I wouldn't rule it out
    theoretically, \[are\] the results in Figure 2 providing enough
    evidence of this? Looking at the two-year bins, it looks more like 0
    and 1-2 being together (same) VS 3-4 and 5-6 being together (same),
    i.e. no dose-response. Perhaps this can be supported via hypothesis
    testing?

6.  It would be interesting to see if there are any effects on birth
    outcomes, such as birth weight \[or\] gestational age (if these have
    been measured in the survey). Additionally, it would be interesting
    to see if there is an effect on sex ratio for births
    (proxy/indicator for fetal loss).

7.  Are there any other health outcomes measured at (or before) age 5?
    Height, for example, to examine stunting?

8.  If either of the two previous suggestions are true, and provided the
    same measurement for the parents exists, it would be interesting to
    compare same outcomes for parents and their children and the impact
    of the intervention on their correlation.

9.  I found the heterogeneous results by parents' age too interesting
    and valuable to be pushed to the appendix. Perhaps some could be
    moved to the main body (e.g. Tables A2 and A5) along with further
    discussion. Also, Table A.6 is not mentioned anywhere in the text (I
    can see how column (2) is replication of column (9) Table 2, but
    would be worth a brief discussion of overall findings).

10. The authors mention in the discussion the study of Duhon et al.
    (2023)[@nolod0zuay8] on other aspects of the intergenerational
    transmission of human capital. Although the discussion of the
    non-/cognitive gains is beyond the focus of this paper, a brief
    discussion of the health gains examined in that study would be
    beneficial for the reader.

11. I think the authors would assist the reader by providing discussion
    (or direct comparison when possible) of the study of Barham et al.
    (2023)[@nlbdx8gb258] in Bangladesh, as it's the one most closely
    related to theirs (or any other among the ones cited).
