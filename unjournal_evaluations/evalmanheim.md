## Written report

Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) are a promising and already burgeoning
area for global health aid for new vaccines and therapies, and have been
widely used and discussed in the short time since their initial
proposal. They also have been suggested as promising to speed up
response for urgent needs during an emerging disease pandemic, making
them potentially relevant for reducing global catastrophic biorisk.

This paper reviews recent uses and theory about AMCs, and in addition to
a more general review, it seems useful to consider some of the claims
more critically, and then to consider the relevance for key global
priorities. I therefore begin with a review of the contents and claims,
including a critique, then discusses relevance to global health and to
pandemic preparedness and response.

As an overview of Advanced Market Commitments, the paper is excellent.
It addresses many key points about the theoretical economic
justification, provides data on the brief but very successful history of
AMC usage in the past 2 decades, and the issues with the design which
have been identified and are still relevant. The last section,
especially the discussion of distant technological targets, has a number
of implications, however, which are not fully explored - and which are
critical to applications of the paper.

In both the initial theoretical section and the final section, the paper
discusses use of AMCs for theoretically distant targets. The issues with
doing this are discussed, however, the scope of the paper means that
alternative approaches are not explored. They note that AMCs are
intended to "supplement, not replace, direct R&D support."

To discuss why the limitation in the scope of the paper to AMCs is
problematic, it is useful to more clearly explain the conceptual framing
the paper uses, "Push" and "Pull" funding. Push funding includes grants,
scientific research funding, and other mechanisms which lead to but do
not actually require production of the final product. This is designed
to pay for innovation and research, but leaves the actual production to
the market, with attendant market failures, which the paper discusses.
Pull funding includes purchases and Advanced Market Commitments, and is
designed to get the final product produced. But other mechanisms, such
as prizes and option-based guarantees do not fit neatly into this
framing, and are therefore unfortunately ignored. They also address very
different parts of the potential market failure, and it seems likely
that many of the issues which exist for AMCs to address technologically
distant targets are better addressed using a combination of approaches,
and AMCs may play a limited role.

As [I have argued elsewhere](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-1154),
there are a variety of tools other than AMCs, including prizes, more
direct public-private partnerships, and the proposed options-based
guarantees. While the last category is most appropriate for urgent but
technologically distant targets, the other two provide more of a
spectrum. They also provide different tradeoffs, for example, because
prizes do not need to pre-select the number of firms. An analysis of the
appropriate tool for different future needs would therefore be even more
useful.

The relevance of AMCs for global priorities is therefore mixed. They are
appropriate and very sorely needed for continued and expanded use in
global health and disease elimination campaigns. As the paper notes,
they have likely already saved 700,000 lives, though how counterfactual
this estimate is remains unclear - but they have the potential to be
used further, and save an order of magnitude more lives in the near
term. They also have potential to accelerate vaccines for known
pandemic-potential pathogen threats, including use for universal
influenza vaccines to address novel influenza, and similarly for
pan-betacoronavirus vaccines. The optimal strategy presumably involves a
mix of different tools, but policy considerations for which approach to
use will also be critical, and the track record of AMCs is a significant
advantage.

On the other hand, for technologically more distant targets, it seems
the paper oversells the usefulness of AMCs compared to the alternatives.
Most critically, the use of AMCs for novel diseases seems far more
limited than other avenues. In the event of a novel disease pandemic, as
COVID-19 showed, funding availability and advanced purchases were not
the key constraints for getting vaccines developed. Instead, the slow
nature of the testing and approval processes were critical, and AMCs
typically do not provide direct marginal incentives for speed.
Additionally, the relative lack of investment in manufacturing capacity
to speed up availability was critical.

On the other hand, if combined with general research funding for
programs like the proposed "prototype pathogen" research, which would
develop candidate vaccines for critical viral families, then AMCs could
be made more useful, though it remains unclear why they would be
preferred to more direct funding and purchases.
