# Written report

Thank you for inviting me to review this manuscript. I was asked to
review the version shared on NBER and I note for the purposes of this
review I have read the NBER paper, as well as the now-published version
in AER: Insights. In the published version, the authors have already
addressed some of my original minor comments (e.g. clarity regarding
report sample sizes per group and randomization process - now much
clearer, e.g. through a flowchart). I find this manuscript to be very
clearly written and sound in terms of experimental design.

## Summary: 

This study is an RCT delivered in Ghana, providing group cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT). Participants were reported to be from the
general population, although notably the 40 compounds selected for
inclusion were those reporting the lowest average household proxy means
test score. Individuals were not targeted based on pre-existing mental
health problems or levels of distress. Results are assessed after a 2-3
month follow-up. Somewhat surprisingly, there is no evidence of
heterogeneity by baseline mental distress. Authors report improvements
in a variety of outcomes of interest, broadly described as 'mental and
physical health, cognitive and socioemotional skills, and downstream
economic outcomes'.

## Rationale & Framing[^1]

My main critical comment pertains to the rationale of providing CBT to
'a general population of poor people'. I acknowledge that the included
population does include a large proportion of individuals reporting
distress (70% moderate or severe levels) and equally that the authors
address the lack of specific targeting to a given extent. Nevertheless,
I think this could have been further developed and the language made
more precise. Communicating around the policy implications could be
particularly important if such otherwise promising and effective
interventions are to be scaled and adopted more widely.

There has been a real boom in investigations of therapy provision in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and I worry that the current
work sits in the context of a growing literature that poses a risk of
stigmatizing people who live in poverty and a danger of pushing towards
the provision of psychosocial support as a primary vehicle to poverty
alleviation, above and beyond much needed developmental work. This
argument has already been posed by others such as Lant Pritchett
("Development work versus charity work").[^2]

Improvements in infrastructure and the availability of accessible mental
health care globally are needed, as well as effective interventions that
improve the lives of vulnerable people living in poverty. At the same
time, mental health interventions focus on improving targetable
individual-level factors rather than factors at a macro-level. In
broader behavioral science contexts, others have potently argued that
individual-level solutions have led 'public policy astray' and are a
misuse of resources ([@temp_id_3740101287626443]).

## Follow-ups

A key step in further research on this topic should be longer
follow-ups. This is a limitation not only to this particular work but
also more broadly to psychotherapeutical interventions in LMICs (e.g.
meta-analysis from Lund et al., 2022; NB working paper). For instance,
as the authors acknowledge, in a related comparable paper with a longer
follow-up, Haushofer et al. ([@temp_id_7338149165558308]) contrastingly
find null effects unlike the positive effects reported here. The
potential of time decay is a crucial limitation for me. More positively,
in their working paper Lund and colleagues find some initial evidence to
suggest that psychotherapy can somewhat outperform unconditional cash
transfers both in terms of cost and effectiveness regarding health and
economic outcomes. More research is needed to make stronger claims with
greater confidence, but taking the present paper and the existing
literature, providing psychosocial support to people in LMICs seems to
be a promising way to improve lives and can effectively sit within a
package of offered support to help empower and lift people out of
poverty. Notably, as well, Lund et al. provide more exploratory evidence
that pairing economic and therapeutic support outperforms therapy on its
own.

## Outcomes

● Authors describe that the intervention led to 'meaningful' average
increases in the studied outcomes. I'm unsure if increases in reports
regarding good mental health '0.53 days per month' is particularly
strong in this regard.

● As a clinical psychologist, the convention in my discipline is to
consider p \> .05 as non-significant so my disposition regarding some
outcomes that are barely significant at the .1 level is one of
skepticism (e.g. 0.53 days with better mental health, p = .097; on
average 0.48 days when poor health prevented engaging in regular
activities for people with distress, p = .097).

● While the improvements in digit span could likely be interpreted as
based on increases in 'bandwidth' associated with CBT, other cognitive
scientists have been more skeptical about the use of working memory
tests in the first place and have suggested these tend **to** be stable
and working memory largely not malleable; hence their use should occur
in the context of a broader cognitive battery.

● Generally I find the created indices to be reported clearly, although
a touch further detail on the exact procedure (weights?) would have been
welcomed. I note in passing that there are some existing recommendations
in my field that caution the use of composite measures as this can pose
a challenge to clarifying the mechanisms of action. In this particular
case I think the risk is fairly low, given that the mental health index
includes exclusively self-report measures clustering around distress,
and the socioemotional skills index is also self-report, clustering
around self-control.

● The 'downstream economic outcomes index' also comprises entirely
self-reported measures on 'the number of work days missed due to poor
mental or physical health, self-reported economic status... and a
self-evaluation of expected economic status in five years.' Including
objective measures would provide a stronger degree of evidence. That an
intervention targeting (in part) improvements in cognition and
self-assessment changed self-reported measures pertaining to
'self-evaluation' is a sign that the intervention worked well in its
primary domain, but further measurement specificity and validity will be
beneficial in future work.

## Mechanisms

● Hard to isolate effects of CBT vs socialization effects (therapy
provided in groups of 10 people) but this is a general concern for group
therapy interventions and a question for appropriate control condition
selection.

● Although the authors propose one underlying mechanisms (CBT -\> better
cognitive and socioemotional skills -\> improvements in human capital),
other possible mechanisms are still likely (cf. [@lund2022treating]) and
future efforts should be directed to clarifying the causal mechanisms so
interventions can be optimized.

## Other

● Data for this trial were collected prior to the announcement of other
interventions (including provisioning of a cash transfer). I appreciate
the transparency regarding reporting this. I still wonder how likely it
is that people who were surveyed extensively about their financial
position did not anticipate any further trial. Hard to assess the
likelihood of any further demand characteristics, though some have
argued this is generally common for interventional contexts in LMICs.

● I note in passing that a broader cognitive battery with greater
ecological validity in its tests would have provided further support
that the scarcity/bandwidth framing is appropriate. Scarcity experiments
have largely been lab-based and so more abstract with potential not to
correspond to lived experience. I'm uncertain how helpful framing around
ideas such as 'poverty leads people to give into temptation' really is.
We know people managing restricted incomes may spend their finances in
seemingly 'suboptimal' ways - for instance, choosing to buy sugar
instead of more nutrition-dense foods but these choices may not reflect
irrationality but a more diverse set of priorities (e.g. wanting to
enjoy flavor after eating only rice).

● As another minor comment expressed with some uncertainty, I'm not sure
about the validity/appropriateness of claims such as people living in
poverty being constantly presented with 'stimuli regarding their own
status... an individual born into a poor farming family may
misinterpreted his low income as evidence of his own low levels of
talent..." and beliefs such as 'my efforts never pay off" etc. These are
certainly defensible positions (as is the whole theoretical framing of
the paper) but I find it equally plausible that there might not be
self-centering in attributing 'blame' for all. People can still
experience distress while recognizing external factors (e.g. "my yield
is bad because of the bad weather that affected my crops"). I then
wonder if the external environment is not a target as well. Otherwise if
we improve people's mental health in the short-term via psychosocial
intervention but do not protect against negative environment shocks by
directly addressing macro-level/environmental factors, people can still
be trapped in the vicious cycle between poverty and poor mental health
(e.g. [@temp_id_2620833064407162]; [@n8wal7gjh84]).
