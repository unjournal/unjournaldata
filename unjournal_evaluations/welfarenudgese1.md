# Abstract 

The present paper reports on nudges failing to improve utilitarian
welfare because they increase higher-order choice distortions. While the
paper is highly complex in practically all regards, their general idea
is important for public policy. The welfare losses implied by nudges may
not be large, and real-life policymaking emphatically does not proceed
by maximizing utilitarian welfare, but this paper could represent a step
forward in how we think about policy incidence over the whole
distribution of behaviors.

# Written report

*This is a review of 'When Do "Nudges" Increase Welfare?' by Allcott et
al. (September 20, 2023 version). I review this version over the NBER
version because it is more recent.*

## Summary

The authors show theoretically how nudges change prices in equilibrium
and how their economic effects differ from those of taxes. Even when
nudges change average behavior in beneficial ways, they may increase the
variance of distortions, decreasing welfare. They use two artefactual
incentivized experiments to demonstrate these theoretical findings.

## Comments

1.  This paper appears to be a very substantial contribution to the
    study of nudges and similar behavioral interventions. While the
    theoretical analysis hinges on the assumption that taxes are
    optimal, there is of course a large literature on the heterogeneous
    effects of policy. To pick a random example, Manning, Blumberg, and
    Moulton (1995)[@temp_id_7520021296183663] show how different
    utilizers of alcohol react differently to increases in alcohol
    taxes. That policy has heterogeneous effects is by itself not a
    novel insight, but it is nonetheless important.

2.  The most significant finding in this paper is in section 1.4,
    equation 6. That nudges can influence prices in equilibrium is a
    result of high practical relevance. Previous work may have
    implicitly assumed nudges to be "too small." Section 1.4 would
    deserve a more central place in the paper. Policymakers simply
    cannot know (Hayek 1945)[@npfx8u5qlkf] what the boundaries of
    interventions are, even when their effects are thought to be local.

3.  The presentation of the paper is slightly difficult. In the whole
    paper, highly technical and complicated language is used. But simple
    is better than complex, and complex is better than complicated. An
    example is "The remaining bars present conditional ATEs within the
    sample of participant-by-product pair observations with below-median
    or above-median bias or externality estimates" (p. 22). In other
    cases, the paper uses unknown terms such as "highly statistically
    *insignificant*" (sic, emphasis mine, p. 22). The introduction is
    already quite technical; section 1, in my opinion, is appropriate.
    Section 2 is almost unintelligible. This is because the experimental
    design is never clearly stated. Even though the "cars" and "drinks"
    experiments share many features (as hinted at in section 2 after the
    heading), readers require clarity to understand the multiple
    elicitations and the exact procedure that subjects underwent. The
    understanding of the "cars" experiments is complicated by the
    unceasing use of brand and product names that are not necessary for
    understanding. Section 3 is highly technical; many econometric
    aspects could be moved to the appendix.

4.  Once the experiments are understood, they certainly make sense.
    However, I do have issues with how subjects would perceive certain
    aspects of them. Most striking is the WTP elicitation for car leases
    *if gas is free*. This seems difficult to make sense of intuitively.
    Because this setup is so unusual, the experiment will inevitably
    elicit numeracy, and any elicitation also be affected by cognitive
    uncertainty (Enke and Graeber 2019)[@temp_id_08314283577777726].
    Bias is only identified under the strong assumption that such
    considerations are not relevant. While recent work has demonstrated
    that demand effects may not matter much or at all in experimental
    designs (De Quidt, Haushofer, and Roth
    2018)[@temp_id_5001323608307828], they may still be significant here
    due to the multiple elicitation.

5.  In general, I have to praise the transparency the researchers use
    when making their assumptions. Even though sections 3 and 4 are
    highly technical---and contain some of the densest writing I have
    ever encountered---I believe the authors take assumptions and models
    seriously. On the one hand, the models described in section 3 are
    clearly in reduced form. On the other hand, the authors make
    substantial assumptions to identify otherwise structural parameters
    such as $\text{Var}\lbrack\tau\rbrack$. This positions their
    econometric model somewhere between "reduced form" and "structural"
    approaches; it also means that this paper uses a "model" approach,
    where many objects of interest are not directly observable through
    the "design," but only implicitly contained.

6.  It should be clarified that some of the effects seem quite small,
    especially for cars. The abstract already says that "labels \[...\]
    may decrease welfare." The authors effectively use figures to
    communicate their ideas, but they should seek to find plausible
    numerical configurations that allow them to make clearer statements
    about the effects of nudges in their examples. It is important to
    note that this paper represents a "proof of concept"---and that is a
    true strength of this work. It is still important to provide readers
    with tangible, real-life ideas about the effect of some sample
    interventions.

7.  In general, I do not believe it to be appropriate to drop
    observations without preregistration. (At the time of review, a full
    and transparent preregistration was not publicly available.) This
    point becomes even clearer when the authors write that "excluding
    these outlying responses is conservative" (p. 15). I obviously
    understand the wish for precision in estimation, but if it doesn't
    matter, then don't do it. The preregistration should always be
    followed. If there is no preregistration, then no data should be
    dropped.

8.  In general, if a difference is "not statistically significant," then
    no conclusion should be drawn as if it were. The manuscript (p. 22)
    contains several instances of suggestive phrases that frame the
    experimental results in terms favorable to the authors'
    interpretation. That is not permissible. However, I am not sure
    whether section 3.2.2 is necessary. Its many caveats paired with
    overconfident statements certainly make for a confusing read. The
    entire paper could benefit from clarifications and simplifications.

## Global priorities

How does this paper help us deal with global priorities, such as
statecraft, governance and democracy? It certainly highlights the
challenges of policymaking. While the paper itself represents a "proof
of concept" that nudges can diminish welfare through unexpected
channels, we have to ask ourselves what this implies. On the one hand,
optimal policies are shown to be difficult (and the paper's application
of optimal tax theory should not be taken as a prediction that taxes
always work optimally).

However, it was recognized early by the public finance literature that
policymakers can insert their own views into policymaking, even if such
insertion is justified on the presumption of asymmetric information
(e.g., the case of "merit goods:" Musgrave 1959,
1956)[@n9n7guk9ouz][@ns18qxw857w]. Furthermore, Peltzman
(1976)[@nwy5czdx57o] considered a situation in which policymakers work
to improve their *own* lot. Recent research by Ambuehl, Bernheim, and
Ockenfels (2021)[@temp_id_6278021391435369] extends to paternalism, with
paternalists imposing *their own* preference. To that extent, the
present paper does not necessarily provide a description of policymaking
processes as they currently exist; and because the authors
(understandably) miss the true motivations for governance and
intervention, this paper is unlikely to improve what is globally
important. Their demonstration is still significant, as it shows how
optimality is easily missed even with well-intentioned, utilitarian
policymakers.

## Open science and replicability

The authors provide a full replication package. Furthermore, their
experimental design---once fully understood---is easy to replicate
materially. The authors are transparent about their assumptions
vis-á-vis econometrics (despite the substantial complexity of their
analyses). In this regard, the authors made laudable efforts.

## Conclusion

The present paper reports on nudges failing to improve utilitarian
welfare because they increase higher-order choice distortions. This is a
highly original contribution. While the paper is highly complex in
practically all regards, their general idea is a curious addition to
what we know about public policy. The welfare losses implied by nudges
may not be large, and real-life policymaking emphatically does not
proceed by maximizing utilitarian welfare, but this paper could
represent a step forward in how we think about policy incidence over the
whole distribution of behaviors.

## Further discussion in response to management notes/questions[^2]

**Managers: **Is a model in which government adjusts taxes/subsidies
optimally a relevant one for this discussion? ...

**Evaluator: **This article is embedded in a recent literature that
tries to compare the relative efficacy of taxes vis-á-vis alternative
policy measures. One of the earliest works that clearly articulates this
line of research is Loewenstein & Chater (2017, reference in original
paper), which has been followed up by various theoretical and empirical
investigations. To properly compare the performance of alternative
policy measures (such as nudges), it is necessary and proper to fix the
alternative that nudges are compared against at the optimal level. Of
course, taxes may (and do) reduce welfare; they are emphatically not
neutral. But this literature seeks to "steelman" taxes and ascertain
whether nudges hold up to the theoretical optimum achievable with taxes.

**Managers: **...Don't we think of nudges usually exactly in places
where we have reason to believe behavior can have an impact, and where
we see no other easy way to steer people in the right direction, e.g.,
as adequate taxes are politically infeasible?

**Evaluator: **I do not see it that way. Governments everywhere have
many tools at their disposal; nudging is a recognition that there may be
additional "knobs" available. The selling point of nudges is that they
have minimal cost yet still are effective. If high taxes on sugary
drinks or cars are politically infeasible, then nudges compare
favorably, but that is only one possible alternative. Nudging may simply
be used to steer a different kind of consumer. In fact, the recognition
of the heterogenous effects of policy tools is one of the major
contribution by the authors.

**Managers: **"We apply our framework to randomized experiments
evaluating automotive fuel economy labels and sugary drink health labels
\..." These experiments were run on a particular pool of participants,
asking questions about particular contexts. Are the inferences made from
these participants in this context meaningful?...

(If so) do the results in this context meaningfully generalize in ways
that will help inform (globally) important real-world policies? 

**Evaluator: **See the main review. The experiment is necessarily highly
stylized and artefactual. Insofar as the authors attempt to verify
theoretical predictions, the experiment is conceptually sound. However,
as stated in the main review, the design is quite complex and the
presentation could be much improved.

Neither the experiment nor the theoretical exhibition can help with
global priorities because governments are by their nature ignorant of
welfare; and welfare is indeed not what is optimized.[^3]

**Managers: **There were some real incentives to choose according to
one's true preferences (in the drinks case?) or to get state WTP
'correctly' as imputed from their earlier survey responses (in the autos
case).  Were these incentives strong, meaningful, and correctly aligned?

**Evaluator: **The incentives have a typical size for experiments, but
they are not as "high stakes" as real-world decisions. Conceptually, the
idea of rewarding participants according to their consistency is sound,
but the complexity of the experimental design may inhibit rational
responses in the first place. Issues with MPLs \[multiple price lists\]
are well-known. However, such a skew would be systematic and independent
of treatment. Sadly, the authors did not present any discussion as to
this inherent cognitive load imposed by their design.

**Managers: **\[Please consider issues surrounding \] the statistical
modeling of the results, statistical inferences, structure of any
structural (?) model used to derive welfare implications; consistency
with pre-registration/pre-analysis plan

**Evaluator: **The most important issue I see is that the authors never
give an example for plausible parameter values. To gauge the importance
of welfare losses of nudging, we need to know some values. Indeed, the
example that they give hints at tiny losses (section 4.4). See the main
review.

The statistical model is quite sophisticated and indeed almost of a
structural nature. This makes it susceptible to modelling choices and
"researcher degrees of freedom," but we cannot know to what extent. I
was not able to find a meaningful preregistration or preanalysis plan.
This must count against the authors, as do the significant exclusions
that they applied seemingly without reason (see section 2.1, " Excluding
these outlying responses is conservative"). If sample sizes and the
exclusions were preregistered (and perhaps even the analyses committed
to via a preanalysis plan), I will happily withdraw this point.
Nonetheless, all assumptions are transparently made and a replication
package is provided.
