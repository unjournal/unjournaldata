# Abstract 

This is a timely study that adds insight into whether and how
unconditional cash transfers to mothers can improve their health and the
health and development of their children in a low resource setting in
India. Major comments include the need to think through equitable
authorship, further describe certain aspects of the intervention (i.e.,
messaging provided to participants), and add detail to the methods
around the use of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire.

# Claim identification and assessment [^4]

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^5] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The authors claim that unconditional cash transfers to mothers in India
increase calorie intake, dietary diversity, and nutrient consumption for
mothers and children, that they narrow gender disparities in food
consumption, and improve early childhood development. These claims are
stated in the paper's abstract. These findings are important because
there is current debate over the effectiveness of unconditional cash
transfers on functional outcomes in women and children. The findings
demonstrate a clear and significant benefit to outcomes that are
meaningful to policy makers.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^6] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

Yes, I believe these claims are true as the data show.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^7] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

As stated in my evaluation, I would like authors to be more clear in the
meaning of their estimates, so that I could state something to the
effect of: unconditional cash transfers to mothers in India, if scaled
up, could results in an increase in X IQ points among young children
living in resource limited settings.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^8] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

As I wrote in my evaluation, I would like to see the estimates
translated into more tangible and clinically meaningful conclusions.
Statistical significance is different from meaningful effects and I am
hoping the authors are able to demonstrate how the effects are indeed
meaningful.

# Written report

This is a timely study that adds insight into whether and how
unconditional cash transfers to mothers can improve their health and the
health and development of their children in a low resource setting in
India. The results give critical insight into effects of cash, a current
topic of debate, with important implications for policy in India and
beyond. The study design is particularly useful in that it allowed for
the assessment of intermediate outcomes.

## Major comments:

In academia, researchers from institutes in the Global North must do
better in pushing for equitable partnerships, particularly when engaging
in research in the Global South. This includes authorship opportunities
for study team members and researchers based in the country in which the
study was conducted. In the spirit of equitable research, I urge the
authors to consider including study investigators who are from
institutes in India and fit criteria for authorship. This type of action
is important in reversing the type of extractive research that has been
commonplace in global health and other disciplines. I have included
below some helpful references:

authorship in collaborative health research in Africa, 2014--2016. BMJ

randomized controlled trials among low- and middle-income country

It would be important to further detail the messaging that mothers
received. We know from previous research that good messaging is critical
to behavior change. Simply giving goods (or in this case, cash) without
proper messaging does not change behaviors in a sustainable manner. How
were participants "encouraged" to use the funds for nutritious foods?
What were they key messages, were these messages related to specific
foods, meal frequency, or amount to consume?? Were they told about the
benefits of nutritious foods for them and/or their child? If directed at
the mother, did the messaging address enhanced nutrition during
pregnancy or postpartum or both? Were they told about what foods are
nutritious and why? Were these foods available and accessible to women?
Who typically purchases food for the family in India (is it a typical
responsibility for the husband or the wife)? Were husbands involved in
the study in any way -- i.e., did they receive any messaging? This could
have happened if message delivery was made in a public forum of some
sort.

I have several comments related to the use and reporting of the Ages and
Stages Questionnaire:

-   As noted, the ASQ3 is parent reported. This trial was not blinded,
    so results could have been biased, which is worth mentioning as a
    key limitation.\

-   Further, the ASQ3 is meant as a screening tool for early childhood
    development, not a test of child's abilities. Typically, it relies
    on cutoffs to determine whether a child is "at risk" of suboptimal
    development in certain domains. An index score for the ASQ3 were
    used in the analysis, but it would be useful to see the analysis for
    differences in proportion of children at risk of developmental
    delays. If not, can authors explain why this was not done?\

-   The authors present results for an overall child development index,
    domain-specific indices, as well as individual ASQ items. They do
    this without accounting for multiple comparisons or presenting this
    as a pre-specified plan. My concern here is that the study was not
    designed or powered to examine all these outcomes, and that these
    outcomes overlap (and are subsets of one another).\

-   Do authors use the term "child development index" to refer to the
    age-standardized scores? If so, this is unclear. Please provide an
    explanation in the text and in the relevant table footnotes for how
    this was calculated.\

-   Lastly, it would be useful to show that the ASQ3 has been validated
    in India.

## Minor comments:

**Section 1 Introduction:**

"﻿As of 2019, 36% of Indian children under five were stunted" -- I
suspect authors mean 36% of children under five living in India. Indian
children may live in other countries.

"﻿Rs. 500, equal to ∼10% of average household consumption" - do authors
mean household income?

I understand the appeal of saying that brains are more important than
brawn, but the statement is misleading because this study does not
measure brawn, it measures anthropometry, which is an indicator of a
deprived environment.

**Section 2 Context and Intervention:**

Section 2.2 "Child development outcomes are poor", but authors then go
on to cite statistics about malnutrition, not child development.
Further, earlier in section 1, "child development" was used to discuss
cognitive and motor development.

The reader could use more information on two items: 1) the control
group, and 2) the nutrition messaging that accompanied the cash
transfers.

What did the control group receive? It is unclear whether those in the
control group were aware of the other group receiving cash while they
did not.

More detail is needed on the nutrition messaging that mothers received.
I have detailed this further in my major comments above.

**Other methods:**

Following the CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials), the
study should include a consort flow diagram. Among other things, this
figure should include numbers and reasons for loss to follow up at each
timepoint.

The trial registration number (and link) should be provided.

**Results**

The sentence on page 19 "provide valuable evidence to the child
nutrition literature that "catch up" growth of children is possible"
could be made clearer by specifying what you mean by catch up growth.
The authors seem to be saying that their results indicate that catch up
growth in children above 2 years of age is possible. Second, authors are
implying that children's linear growth is moving towards a healthy
growth curve, implying that most were at a growth deficit at the start.
Is this the case? It would be good to remind the reader what age range
the siblings were.

Page 21: "range of indicators suggest that improved nutritional intake
for mothers and children translated into accelerated child development".
It seems to me that the results suggest that cash transfers led to
increases in child development. Why are authors focusing here on
nutritional intake rather than the intervention itself?

**Discussion**

The discussion could also comment on whether or not (and how) the
magnitude of the effects are meaningful. There are statistically
significant effects on many outcomes, but how clinically meaningful are
they? For instance, how do the differences in SDs of child development
index translate to IQ points (or something meaningful to policy makers
and others)?
