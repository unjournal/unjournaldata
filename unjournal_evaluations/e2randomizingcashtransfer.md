  Unconditional Cash Transfer Amounts in the US"

# Abstract 

Overall, I find this paper competently executed. I like the inductive
approach to theorizing after the findings, the multiple tests for
mechanism, extensive robustness checks, and the use of transaction-level
data to check what participants used the money for. The paper has
external validity limitations, and can be framed better since the
unconditional cash transfers were given during the Covid pandemic. \[I
suggest\] several further tests to test the main mechanism, and improve
the mediation analysis.

# Written report[^4]

Overall, I find this paper competently executed. I like the inductive
approach to theorizing after the findings, the multiple tests for
mechanism, extensive robustness checks, and the use of transaction-level
data to check what participants used the money for. Overall, I have
several suggestions for improving the paper:

1.  The paper is framed, and the contribution posed mainly about
    unconditional cash transfers (UCT). However, the experiment was
    conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the paper is also
    about UCT during a pandemic. The authors are probably the first ones
    to study this, but this contribution should be made upfront. The
    authors, therefore, should relate to further literature on cash
    transfers during the pandemic.\

2.  Related to the above, the paper has limited external validity given
    the end of the pandemic/conducting the experiment under very
    particular circumstances. This is, of course, beyond the control of
    the authors, so an alternative approach is to recognize upfront the
    context/circumstances under which the experiment was conducted and
    not wait until the conclusion.

3.  As the paper speculates, cash treatments might have been too small
    to reach any positive effect. The problem is that \[the potential
    for\] testing higher-value transfers is limited, given the costs.
    UCTs may be more viable in developing contexts, where the values can
    be larger compared to annual income, as the authors suggests.

4.  The main mechanism behind the potential negative effects of the
    treatment suggests that the UCT can remind receipts of the debts
    that they can\'t cover. Beyond the model, this could be explored
    further empirically; according to the stock of debt pre-treatment,
    do people with higher debt stock have more negative effects? Some
    heterogeneous effects with levels of debt could be done.\

5.  The auxiliary 15 participants\' interviews could be improved by
    improving the sample size and ideally having representative groups
    in treatment and control groups. If the size of the interviewees
    can\'t be scaled up, given that significant time has passed since
    the experiment, at least the authors should do their analysis
    separating interviews from the treatment and control group.

6.  The mediation analysis can be improved in two ways:

    -   The mediators can be further disaggregated; the variables, Money
        Mind -- Cost, Overwhelmed Others\' Needs, and Spending Stress
        can be used in Table H.11 separately to see if main treatment
        effects change, under using only one of those.

    -   Most importantly, the mediation analysis can improve beyond just
        controlling for mediators and checking how the mani effects
        change. For example, see the proposal by Acharya, Blackwell, and
        Sen (2016)[@nkb5mna41v9].\

7.  Did the authors try exploring het\[erogeneous\] effects according to
    the previous level of income? The treatment effects might depend on
    where the participants were in the income distribution/how big the
    cash transfer is with respect to their income.
