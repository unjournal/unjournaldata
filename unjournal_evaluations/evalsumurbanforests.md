# Abstract [^1]

Understanding the health impacts of tree planting and re-greening is
central to understanding the co-benefits and costs of climate and
biodiversity-focused policy. The paper \"Urban Forests: Environmental
Health Values and Risks\"[@nl03a1iedtn] begins to address this question
in a context in which the climate and biodiversity benefits may be small
compared to the more immediate health effects: the re-greening of a mega
city.  We organized two evaluations of this paper. The two evaluations
both recognise the significance of the work, but diverge in their
assessment of the paper's causal identification. Nonetheless, this does
not diminish from the paper's important impact implications: urban
regreening has large positive impacts through substantial reductions in
PM2.5 concentrations despite increases in allergic reactions to the
increased pollen loads. To read these evaluations, please see the links

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

The paper tackles a very interesting and relevant question about the
environmental and health impact of urban forests i.e how human-led
greening of urban areas affects well-being through its impact on
pollution and pollen. The paper's strength lies in bringing together
several data sources with high spatial resolution and decomposing the
policy impact into vegetation density & greenery, air quality and
finally health. Moreover the discussion on health and environment trade
off is also new and insightful. The main critique is that claims of
causality in the paper are not substantiated within the current
estimation framework. However, I believe with the excellent data sources
available to the authors this can be addressed in the future.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

This is an excellent, thorough, and well-written paper on an important
topic of urban greenery and health. The methodology builds on
well-established methods and is convincing with ample placebo and
robustness checks. The authors could further improve policy impact by
expanding on the external validity of these findings by describing,
exploring, and empirically characterizing the setting and MMP further:
what contributes to its success, what greenery is used, and how is the
greenery planted?

# Evaluation manager's discussion [^18]

Understanding the health impacts of tree planting and re-greening is
clearly central to understanding the co-benefits and costs of climate
and biodiversity focussed policy. This paper begins to address this
question in a context in which the climate and biodiversity benefits may
be small compared to the more immediate health effects: the re-greening
of a mega city. 

The two evaluations both recognise the significance of the work, but
diverge in their assessment of the paper's causal identification. In
part, it seems that this is because of slightly different foci.
Evaluation 1 seems to focus on the second half of the paper: "what are
the impacts of re-greening?" Meanwhile, Evaluation 2 has more of a focus
on the link between the specific programme and the resulting
re-greening. Indeed, the strategy to identify the impact of the planting
programme (MMP) could be strengthened by, for instance, including wholly
untreated sites (e.g. other cities). This approach would help
differentiate the effects of the program from those of other policy
levers and general trends.

Nonetheless, this does not diminish from the paper's important impact
implications: urban regreening has large positive impacts through
substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations despite increases in
allergic reactions to the increased pollen loads

## Issues meriting further evaluation

The evaluators generally did a strong job of considering each of the
suggested issues raised [in these
notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ooFQX2oxvpn1YwaMFdZRjWEeHP2i6Kk0oS8HE0gnMkM/edit?tab=t.0 "null"),
which we shared with them. Still, one point that seems to have been
under-addressed is "distributional impacts and inequality---i.e. who
wins or loses from urban greening and how that might vary by
demographics or geography". ([See LLM-assisted discussion at the bottom
of that doc
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ooFQX2oxvpn1YwaMFdZRjWEeHP2i6Kk0oS8HE0gnMkM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.w5433kjokv5x "null").)

# Unjournal process notes 

## Why we chose this paper \[these headings are optional\]

From our internal notes:

> Air quality in Asian cities has been investigated by several EA
> funders (OP, founders pledge). I don't know how much they considered
> urban forests as an intervention, but this paper examines how they
> benefit local air quality, but also increase risks from pollen
> exposure.
>
> This paper studies what I think is a really important question: how
> human-led greening of urban areas affects well-being through its
> impact on pollution and pollen? This seems a highly policy relevant
> question, particularly as the world urbanizes and given that a bunch
> of local governments have the option of making decisions which could
> affect urban greenery. 
>
> These are also ecosystem (dis)services which I don't think have been
> looked at very much in this context (vs, say, recreation benefits, and
> to a lesser extent possibly also reductions in flooding). \
> \
> I also like how they decompose effects: policy -\> changes in greenery
> -\> changes in pollutants -\> changes in health outcomes (rather than
> just policy -\> changes in health outcomes).

## Evaluation process, author engagement

We asked the author team (including early-career researchers) for
permission to evaluate this paper, which they granted.[^19] This can be
seen as a sign of their confidence in their work, truth-seeking mindset,
and commitment to open inquiry. They were very responsive and
encouraging; we are grateful for this cooperation. They opted not to
provide a response to these evaluations, but as always, we welcome a
future response.

As noted above, we shared [these
notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ooFQX2oxvpn1YwaMFdZRjWEeHP2i6Kk0oS8HE0gnMkM/edit?tab=t.0 "null")
with the evaluators, with suggestions for potential issues to consider.
