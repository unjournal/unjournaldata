**Introduction:** We wrote this article as an invited short paper for
the 2020 American Economic Association conference. Given the tight page
constraints, our focus was necessarily limited. The *UnJournal* reports
are if anything more helpful for this short paper than they would be for
a full-length article, suggesting useful ways that the analysis might be
expanded to consider a broader set of mechanisms and settings.

**Acknowledgments:** Before responding to specific comments from the
three reviewers in turn, we want to express our deep gratitude to all
three reviewers for taking the time to review our paper and to the
*UnJournal* for organizing this exercise. We also thank Arthur Baker for
assistance in preparing this note.

**Reviewer 1:** We thank Reviewer 1 for their comments. We agree with
them that there are several market-shaping instruments other than
Advance Market Commitments (AMCs), each of which might be appropriate
for different circumstances. In this short paper, we focused on AMCs,
partly because policymakers decided to implement a \$1.5 billion dollar
AMC. We felt that it was worth discussing the experience of this
practical example. We are not aware of a recent R&D prize of a similar
magnitude to compare to. A fuller theoretical analysis is provided in
our follow-on paper, "Designing Advance Market Commitments for New
Vaccines" ([@temp_id_890412040710507]).

We also agree with Reviewer 1 that AMC would not have been the optimal
contract for COVID-19 vaccines. In "Market Design to Accelerate COVID-19
Vaccine Supply" ([@temp_id_004974877200328409]), two of us along with
coauthors make recommendations for how governments could invest to
accelerate vaccine availability during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather
than an AMC, which is a form of "pull" funding (payments for a
successful innovation), we call for funding roughly 85% of firms'
investment expenditures with "push" funding (payments that reimburse the
firm's R&D investments unconditional on product success). In "Preparing
for a Pandemic: Accelerating Vaccine Availability"
([@temp_id_6846830272630164]), two of us along with coauthors suggest
lessons that can be drawn from the COVID-19 experience for future
pandemics.

We have pointed out other settings where market-shaping mechanisms other
than AMCs may be better for incentivizing vaccine development. In "An
Optimal Mechanism to Fund the Development of Vaccines Against Emerging
Epidemics" ([@temp_id_14045904759296524]), one of use along with
coauthors noted that without additional stipulations, the per-dose
subsidy involved in an AMC may generate perverse incentives for the
efficacy of vaccines administered to quell an emerging epidemic. The
more effective the vaccine, the faster the epidemic is quelled, reducing
the total award under an AMC.

**Reviewer 2:** We thank Reviewer 2 for their comments. We agree that
the results of our empirical exercise should be interpreted with
caution. Regarding their comment, "It would be helpful to know how to
fund an AMC in perpetuity or how to transition off the AMC," the AMC for
a pneumococcal vaccine included a provision committing firms to cap
their prices close to marginal cost. The idea is that the AMC\'s top-up
payments provide sufficient incentive for R&D and capacity investments
even with firms' charging prices close to marginal cost. Firms'
price-cap commitments ensures that vaccines are affordable in the
long-run.

**Reviewer 3:** We thank Reviewer 3 for taking the time and effort to
conduct a quantitative analysis of the speed of rollout of other
vaccines to developing countries. We are gratified to see that they find
that our results should be "fairly robust," given that coverage rates
for alternative comparator vaccines are lower than the comparison we
used, rotavirus.

We agree with the reviewer that there are a number of factors not
included in our rough estimate of the number of DALYs averted due to the
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\'s (PCV's) faster rollout. They mention
two such factors---one which would reduce our estimate and the other
which would increase it---concluding that our estimate might be too
generous. Note that the overall calculation only considers the benefits
from the faster rollout of the PCV starting from the observed date of
availability, taken as given. It understates the value of the AMC to the
extent that the AMC accelerated the vaccine's development.
