# Written report

*Manager's note (David Reinstein): I converted math and Greek letters
into latex format, mainly to demonstrate this capacity. I made no other
changes.\**

Thanks to the Unjournal for their invitation to review "Artificial
Intelligence and Economic Growth". In this essay the authors have three
announced goals: Help set an agenda for research on the impact of AI on
growth, refine research questions on the subject, and summarise and
recontextualize key previous findings with an emphasis on Baumol's cost
disease. This is an ambitious task, but the authors largely succeed!

In the first four sections of the paper, the authors do a wonderful job
of outlining a general neoclassical model of automation. They explain
how the key parameters of the model determine the impact of automation.
They distinguish between two types of economic singularity, and show how
the more extreme variety emerges naturally from some parameterizations
of their model -- something which I believe is an important innovation
of this paper (including above Nordhaus ([@RePEc:nbr:nberwo:21547]) a
direct antecedent paper). These models stimulate the reading researcher
to ask how these parameters could be estimated, opening a door to
applied economists to contribute to the macroeconomic question of growth
and AI. After this, section 5 is a bit of a disappointment. It lists
several additional economic phenomena that might be caused by AI and
automation, and occasionally ties these ideas back to economic growth,
but in a less organised way without the assistance of a model. The essay
closes with empirical evidence on capital shares and automation, which
was adequate for the time empirically, but is somewhat lacking in its
interpretation of the data.

Let me start by going into detail about what I liked about the first
several sections, including some complementary thoughts it inspired in
me. Then I'll explain what I consider the main factor omitted in these
sections: the impact of automation and AI on saving and investment. I'll
close with some thoughts on the limitations of sections 5 and 6, and how
they might be improved.

Section 2 of the paper lays out a general, neoclassical, model of
automation, drawing on Zeira ([@29610cb7-ef18-3307-9aba-2e65cfcf903a])
and Acemoglu and Restrepo ([@temp_id_9149063919932168]). The key
equations are clearly presented. The authors highlight Baumol's \"cost
disease\" \-- the phenomenon that an increase in output of one sector of
the economy will make goods in a complementary sector more expensive \--
as a key phenomenon to be understood for projecting AI and
automation-led growth. \'$\rho$\' is the parameter in the model that
governs how substitutable different goods (for example, automatable and
non-automatable ones) are in the economy. When $\rho$ is smaller, the
economy is relatively more limited by its scarce labor than it is
boosted by automation. It is more likely for interest rates and the
capital share to even decline because of greater automation. This effect
is exacerbated by capital accumulation over time, in contrast to labor
which is inelastically supplied. The way I once heard this phenomenon
described is \"You can always have more capital per-capita, but you
can\'t have more capita per-capita\", and the authors do a good job of
explaining this theme from the previous literature.

The authors do a great job of highlighting the importance of "$\rho$" to
economic growth. Implicitly the authors are suggesting to applied
researchers to go out and measure this elasticity! Between automated and
non-automated tasks, or between relatively capital intensive and labor
intensive sectors, for example.

The authors explain several special cases of their model, to explain how
other parameters balance against each other as well. They focus on the
role of "$\beta$", the share of sectors which are automated. I think the
authors are correct in taking a narrative approach to possible paths
'$\beta$' can take, rather than following Acemoglu and Restrepo
([@temp_id_9149063919932168]) and trying to endogenize it to the
decisions of scientists. It\'s the right level of detail to stop at,
given their more general concerns.

Sections 3 and 4 go farther beyond the current state of the literature,
introducing AI as an input to technology production functions and
considering versions of an economic singularity. Section 3\'s
formalization is clear, but I might have appreciated a note from the
author that other approaches to modelling \"AI in the idea production
function\" might be better \-- whereas I think the model in section 2 is
more solidly paradigmatic. The key parameter here turns out to be
\"$\phi$ \", the rate at which knowledge growth is increasing/decreasing
in the stock of knowledge.

In section 4, the authors lay out what I think are the best taxonomy of
economic singularities I\'ve seen (I think the best alternative that
would have been in the literature at the time would have been Nordhaus
[@RePEc:nbr:nberwo:21547]\'s). While these are somewhat extreme
scenarios, they immediately ground themselves by showing how a type I
case is the natural result of the oldest economic model of automation
\-- the AK growth model. I would make the connection between the AK
growth model and the \"$\rho=\infty$\" (i.e. all goods are perfect
substitutes) case of the general model in section 3 more explicit. The
authors then show that the key parameter determining whether type-2
singularity is $\phi$. In the simpler model (example 2), $\phi$ being
greater than 0 is enough to create an infinite-economic-output
singularity. In the third example, the condition is a slightly more
complicated function of $\phi$. The section closes with an ok discussion
of some more general related concerns regarding an economic singularity,
returning again to $\rho$ and the role of \'scarce bottlenecks\' in
output.

I really appreciated these sections, and feel they do a generally good
job at agenda setting for both theorists and applied researchers. For
applied researchers, I think the way the paper identifies \"$\rho$\",
\"$\phi$\", and \"$\beta$\" as especially important serves as a useful
directive towards what they should attempt to measure. What might have
made the paper even better is a small table with empirical evidence on
these parameters so far, to give the applied researcher inspired by this
paper a starting point.

For the theorist, the mind swims with possible extensions to and
variations on the approaches presented. Obviously a paper like this
can\'t cover or even suggest every possibility. One might imagine
variations of a growth model that allows for \"$\rho$" - which can be
interpreted as a taste parameter - to be endogenous in some way. In
section 5, the authors hint that markups changing over time could be
important. They do the same, in referencing Acemoglu and Restrepo
([@temp_id_9149063919932168]) about making \"$\beta$\" endogenous.
Another natural extension makes labor supply endogenous, or might
explore an automation ---\> politics ---\> growth public choice
mechanism. I don\'t think it\'s a problem that the authors failed to
mention all these possibilities, but some of these I do think are more
interesting and directly connect AI and growth than some of the other
epiphenomena discussed in section 5 (some of which are less clearly
reasoned --- for example, isn\'t it just as plausible to think that AI
will increase centralization and superstar firms as it is to decrease
it?).

Still I do think that the authors fall down in not focusing more heavily
on the role of *saving* in the model. Throughout the paper, the saving
rate in the model is assumed to be constant --- a hypothesis that isn\'t
well grounded in either a representative agent model (which achieves a
constant interest rate in the long run) or an OLG model (in which saving
will be a function of many other considerations). I think this is an
important oversight for a document that wants to set the agenda.

I'll admit I'm a bit of a partisan for this issue, having considered it
in ([@temp_id_5465612051481687]) and ([@nsyq18hz7ut]). In the first
paper, we show how in OLG models automation technologies can actually
lower output and welfare for future generations. The reason is that
savings are made by the young out of their labor incomes, for
consumption in their retirements. When automation accumulates, the share
of income going to young and laboring savers decreases, and the share
going to old spenders increases. This reduces the amount which is saved
and reinvested. In certain cases, the reduced saving effect is large
enough to more than offset the productivity growth effect of automation.
The possibility that a new technology could lower long-run output is not
admitted for in the authors\' model -- ruling out certain conceptually
coherent scenarios such as the one imagined in Asimov's "The Caves of
Steel" -- where highly productive AGIs and automation exists, but a low
saving and reinvestment rate by a socialist government keeps society
impoverished.

More generally, the exogenous saving framework pursued by the authors
doesn\'t allow for any inter-generational analysis of the impact of
automation. On a more practical level, interpreting the decrease in the
global interest rate as telling us something about automation (for
example, see the recent \"cite\") needs to account for global
demographic and distributional factors that have created a \"global
saving glut\" (cite). In ([@temp_id_08271733201349196]), we find that
even a rate of automation at 5x the historical rate would fail to
overcome this headwind and increase interest rates.

This brings me to the final section of the paper, on the evidence to
date on automation and capital shares. Karabarbounis and Neiman
([@temp_id_25607496424967136]) is correctly taken as the starting point,
and I think the discussion is ok for the time overall. My main quibble
is with the characterization of Autor et. al.
([@RePEc:cep:cepdps:dp1482]) and Barkai ([@temp_id_4052380348827558]).
These are presented as \'alternative theories of capital share\'s
increase\' but they\'re more like alternate theories of what $K+N$ are
measuring. These papers and Barkai and Benzell ([@nq0963y2x03]) claim it
is the profit share of income which is increasing, not the capital
share, a theory that is consistent with the microevidence on markups
(for example, [@temp_id_6926470435956444]). That has tremendous
implications for its interpretation in a model of automation. For
example Benzell et al ([@nganpbt4bqv]) theorise that the profit share
has increased because certain inelastically supplied inputs in the
economy are complements to automation and measured as profits. Why do I
mention this? Well, because it has dramatic implications for whether the
$\rho<1$ or $\rho>1$ case is true: If $\rho \lt 1$ then \"capital
share\" shouldn\'t be increasing, especially if interest rates and
growth are low. On the other hand, $\rho>1$ implies an AK world
asymptotically, which also seems unlikely. We think it more likely that
$\rho$ is $\lt 1$ , but physical capital\'s share is actually
decreasing, which is how Benzell et al ([@nspyow4tdjy]) reconciles this
riddle.

## Evaluator details

**How long have you been in this field?**

I started my PhD in Economics in 2012. I became interested in the impact
of automation on economic growth shortly after, so about 10 years.

**How many proposals and papers have you evaluated?**

I have reviewed about 30 papers. I'd say about ⅓ to ½ of these are
broadly on the subject of automation.
