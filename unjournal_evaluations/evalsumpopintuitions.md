# Abstract 

This work [@nfwfrr594f1] is among the first empirical papers considering
attitudes towards population ethics. We commissioned two evaluations,
from experts with complementary backgrounds. The first evaluator
(Bruers, with expertise in welfare economics and normative ethics) rates
the paper highly, while E2 (an \~experimental economist) is moderately
favorable. Both see a contribution ("Highly policy relevant", "valuable
empirical insights"). Both offer some critiques and provide suggestions
for robustness checks and ambitious future work. Bruers expresses "weak
confidence" in the paper's "main result" that "people do not hold the
neutrality and procreation asymmetry intuitions", loosely suggesting we
should "prioritize existential risk reduction". E2 criticizes the
paper's fundamental approach as: (1) unable to accommodate
non-utilitarian beliefs/behavior, (2) implying an unrealistic "hedonic
arithmetic" and (3) relying on "choices between populations" that may
not reflect inherent axiological preferences. E2 also raises doubts
about underpowered null results, limited characterisations of
uncertainty, and the authors' approach to aggregating participant
responses into a "people believe" statement. To read these evaluations,
please see the links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Stijn Bruers

Highly policy relevant, original research with clear hypothesis tests
and valid statistical analyses.\
\
Biases and framing effects are mitigated but remain difficult to avoid
in such surveys. Some results (e.g. the negative utilitarian judgments
and a lack of asymmetry) seem to be contradictory. One possible
explanation for an apparent contradictory result is not addressed.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

This research provides valuable empirical insights into population
ethics intuitions through well-designed experiments. The methodological
progression from simple to complex scenarios demonstrate important
patterns in moral reasoning. While the utilitarian framework
dramatically overlooks crucial dimensions of human flourishing, reducing
the validity of these studies, the data show how ordinary people resist
purely arithmetic approaches to population welfare.

# Evaluation manager's discussion (Nicolas Treich)

This paper is among the first to empirically investigate key questions
in population ethics, addressing a critical gap in a field that has been
predominantly abstract and theoretical. The existing literature is
grounded in utilitarian philosophy, especially following Parfit's
seminal work (1984), along with significant contributions from welfare
economics, notably Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson
(2005).[@https://doi.org/10.1017/CCOL0521825512
] In contrast, this paper adopts an empirical perspective, drawing on
psychological methods and experimental designs to elicit laypeople's
judgments on central principles of population ethics, such as the
average vs. total utilitarianism debate and the procreation asymmetry.\
\
The paper was reviewed \[evaluated\] by two experts with complementary
backgrounds. One reviewer, Bruers, with expertise in welfare economics
and normative ethics, highlights the policy relevance of the research,
characterizing it as original and rigorous, with clearly formulated
hypotheses and robust statistical analysis. He supports the paper's
overall validity and offers constructive comments, particularly
regarding an important framing issue. The second reviewer, an anonymous
specialist in experimental economics, also acknowledges the empirical
contribution of the work, especially its novel insights into population
ethics derived from carefully crafted experiments. However, this
reviewer is very critical of the utilitarian framework and what they
describe as a \"purely arithmetic\" approach. While one may or may not
agree with this critique, it raises important questions and stimulates
valuable discussion for scholars engaged in the field of population
ethics.

## Why we chose this paper 

See [The Unjournal's
criteria](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/what-research-to-target "null") 
(potential for impact, etc.)

ChatGPT's response provided a good baseline:

> This research investigates fundamental moral intuitions that inform
> decisions around population ethics, including how individuals
> aggregate well-being and suffering, the symmetry or asymmetry with
> which they value happiness and suffering, and the moral weight placed
> on creating new lives. These issues are directly relevant to global
> priorities as they underpin ethical decision-making in long-term
> policy and humanitarian contexts, notably affecting the allocation of
> resources towards future-oriented global welfare and existential risk
> reduction.

But the above statement is a bit vague on an actual theory of
change/path to impact. Considering this further (David Reinstein's own
writing)...

Measures of lay people's moral beliefs and intuitions about population
ethics could be used to inform policy and funding decisions that aim to
reflect the popular will. Empirical evidence on people's moral belief
systems could influence, and may already be influencing real-world
choices, e.g., perhaps the development of 'aligned' AI models by
powerful organizations like Anthropic.

The framing of the questions seems likely to impact the typical
responses. Advocates for a particular approach to population ethics
could also use this research to frame public surveys, referenda, and
debates in ways that are likely to lead to outcomes they prefer. This
could be used to positive or negative effect (depending on whether the
people that use it are 'right'). These insights might also help us frame
these in more *neutral*, arguably fairer ways, or at least in multiple
ways that are likely to trigger a range of intuitions. People aiming to
uncover \~moral truths about population ethics through introspection and
discussion may also find it useful to consider this as evidence for the
ways their own intuitions may be affected by these framing.

## Author engagement

The authors thanked the evaluators for their "detailed feedback and
constructive suggestions". They declined to provide a formal response.

    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: Experiments are well-designed and minimal, though sample selection
    is an issue

[^6]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\

    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^13]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^15]: As noted, this paper has already been published in the journal
    \"Cognition\". In our "guidelines for evaluators" we request:\
    \
    "If this work has already been published, and you know where, please
    report the prediction you would have given absent that knowledge."\
    \
    We may consider revising this recommendation; it\'s certainly a
    challenging hypothetical to consider.

[^16]: The paper has already been published in a top field journal.

[^17]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^18]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^19]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^20]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\
