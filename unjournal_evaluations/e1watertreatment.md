# Abstract 

We evaluated the conduct, analysis and interpretation of the
meta-analysis findings. The paper concerns an important topic for the
global burden of infectious disease, particularly in middle-income
countries where most of the included studies were conducted. It presents
useful information on childhood mortality following water treatment and
protection interventions. However, we had major concerns about conduct
and reporting, which did not follow systematic review standards of
transparency, and we also had major concerns about the interpretation of
the findings for policy and research.

## **Introduction**

> *The evaluators support systematic reviews and meta-analyses like
> these*

As authors of a systematic review published last year (Sharma
Waddington, Masset, Bick and Cairncross, 2023)[@n31xouslp6c], which
included many of the same studies as the review by Michael Kremer and
colleagues (hereafter the "review authors" or "reviewers"), we have been
able to undertake a thorough evaluation of the review. Policy decision
making should be based on the results of systematic, critically
appraised evidence rather than single studies (Waddington et al.,
2012)[@nhtb4nn52om], hence we support the approach the reviewers have
taken to collect and synthesize the evidence systematically.

> *Highly relevant*

Furthermore, the topic of the review is highly relevant for global
health policy, perhaps even more so than the review indicates. For
example, interventions that aim to provide populations access to
improved water supplies in quantity and/or quality have been shown in
systematic reviews to be strongly associated with reductions in
diarrheal *illness* (Wolf et al., 2022[@nwsyglpsh13]; Ross et al.,
2023)[@nazvemjcqru], yet a systematic link to reported *mortality* had
not been made until recently (Sharma Waddington et al.,
2023)[@nhtl0rdcezu]. This is important since an estimated 90 percent of
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for diarrhea are due to
mortality, mainly in childhood, the remaining 10 percent coming from
episodes of illness across the whole population. The Global Burden of
Disease (GBD) estimates for drinking water supplies (Wolf et al.,
2023)[@ntdm5hr5kjz] are currently based on systematic reviews of illness
reported by children's carers, under the bold assumption that morbidity
due to causes like diarrhea is closely correlated with mortality. By
collecting and reporting data on losses to follow-up due to mortality
contained in participant flow diagrams in reports of randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) published in health journals, and by obtaining
unpublished data on mortality from authors working in development
economics and health, the review provides direct estimates of mortality
in childhood from water treatment and protection interventions, which
can potentially be used in future GBD calculations.

> *Other strengths: CEA, sensitivity analysis, etc.*

We also believe there is much to praise about the review's
methodological ambition to provide information for decision makers. For
example, it includes cost-effectiveness analysis of various
interventions, which is rarely done in meta-analyses. It employs
prediction intervals to estimate the impact of a new intervention, and
in this way it aims to account for heterogeneity between studies.
Finally, it undertakes sensitivity analyses including estimating
frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses, together with an assessment of
small study effects that finds no evidence for publication bias for
mortality outcomes, which is a very rare finding in the literature on
intervention effects.

Our major concerns about the paper relate to how the systematic review
and meta-analysis have been conducted and reported, and how the analysis
has been interpreted, as we discuss below.

## **Systematic review conduct**

An important aspect of systematic reviewing is transparency in conduct
and reporting, which helps to ensure the analysis can be replicated by
others. The reviewers conducted systematic searches for published RCTs
on water treatment and protection interventions, harvesting data on
all-cause mortality that were reported in participant flow diagrams in
some studies, and contacting authors of RCTs to obtain unpublished data
on all-cause mortality in childhood that were not already in the public
domain. Systematic searches might miss studies, particularly if the
searches cut across academic disciplines; in this case, RCTs of diarrhea
morbidity have been published by economists and epidemiologists. A
previous version of the review omitted several trials that were included
in the systematic review and meta-analysis of water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH) and mortality by us (Sharma Waddington et al.,
2023)[@n7kuggqmsar], several of which have since been included in the
meta-analysis as indicated by the reviewers.

> *Why were some studies excluded?*

However, several studies of apparently eligible interventions, which
reported all-cause mortality in participant flow diagrams, remain
excluded from the analysis. These include Ercumen et al.
(2015)[@ngjqq4fkj36] which reports all-cause mortality from two trial
arms (chlorine plus safe storage and safe storage alone), and Bowen et
al. (2012)[@n384ae9h09a], a long-term follow-up of another household
water treatment (HWT) study that was included (Luby et al.,
2006)[@ncg1wdycp4r]; both studies, while underpowered, reported *higher*
mortality rates in the household water treatment group than in the
control.

> *Lack of PRISMA approach; deviations from pre-registration*

In some respects, the review is transparent about what was done.
Although a systematic review protocol was not, to our knowledge,
registered with any of the usual repositories for such studies (e.g.,
Campbell, Cochrane, Prospero), a pre-analysis plan was submitted to the
AEA registry in June 2020. Fig 1 provides information about the search
process and Table S2 provides information about which studies were
excluded from the analysis, together with the reason why, although not
in the usual form that a systematic review would provide. Reputable
journals require systematic reviews to present a Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) study search
flow diagram, discussion of excluded studies that users might reasonably
expect to be included, and a PRISMA checklist that indicates, for
example, deviations from protocol.[^2] There appeared to be deviations
from the AEA registry record, such as the original exclusion of "cases
where the study population is considered to be non-representative (e.g.
interventions targeting HIV+ populations)" (Tan and Kremer,
2020)[@n9xy5jm1v38]. The review included a study of water filters and
safe storage by Rachel Peletz and colleagues that was conducted among
immunocompromised households (Peletz et al., 2012)[@n6tnltdvvtl]. We
also wondered why a RCT on household water chlorination in Kenya (Kremer
et al., 2008)[@niqsvdrjlpx] was not included in the analysis or in Table
S2; this study aimed to evaluate the final pathway in water-borne
diarrhea disease transmission by addressing contamination between source
and point of use, and is therefore potentially highly policy relevant.

> *Differences between drafts; inter-rater assessments*

We understand the working paper we have been sent to review is the
second draft of a paper that has been online since 2023. We observed
that the odds ratio estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals
(95%CIs) differed, in some cases considerably, between the two working
paper drafts. For example, we observed absolute differences in odds
ratios of 0.04 or more for half (9) of the estimates (Boisson et al.,
2013 [@nsib3l0fa8y]; **Chiller et al., 2006 **[@nyl5pb6wr5o]; **Dupas et
al., 2021 **[@n6r8087bvfv]; **Haushofer et al., 2020 **[@nehe2l41b0w]**;
Luby et al., 2006 **[@n7ioy29ndc3]**; Reller et al., 2003
**[@nuon2uw6pwz]**; Semenza et al., 1998 **[@nqdldn91aq8]; Peletz et
al., 2012 [@nryar9e14uq]; Kremer et al., 2011 [@n314q6dsy47]), of which
six (in bold) had differences of 0.08 or more. As a benchmark, the
pooled effect in frequentist random-effects analysis was 0.75, hence
these differences represent around one-third or more of the pooled
effect magnitude. It is not clear to what extent the differences
mattered for the findings, since in some cases the odds ratios were
smaller, while others were bigger. However, we note that in the first
draft of the review, the frequentist meta-analysis pooled effect for the
chlorination sub-group was not statistically significant, whereas in the
version evaluated by us, the review was able to find a significant
effect, albeit over a slightly larger sample size. Hence, we believe it
would be useful for the review to report inter-rater assessments on
effect size data extraction and/or to indicate how discrepancies in the
calculations were resolved, particularly regarding differences in
estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

> *Risk-of-bias assessment for RCTs; reporting bias for mortality vs
> morbidity*

A key component of systematic reviewing is to undertake a transparent
critical appraisal of the included evidence using risk-of-bias
assessments, to help the reader understand how trustworthy are the
findings from the included studies. The review does report a
risk-of-bias assessment, using a tool that was developed primarily to
assess observational studies, but the assessments are not discussed in
the text or supplement. The review indicates that all studies are RCTs
but, as is well known, RCTs can be at 'high risk of bias' due to
problems in design or conduct, an example being selection biases due to
high (or highly differential) losses to follow-up (attrition) in
treatment and control arms, or joiners in cluster-RCTs. Another key
aspect of the risk of bias concerns the quality of outcomes data
collected. The review mentions that mortality data are more accurate and
less biased than reported illness, even in unblinded trials. This is
surely correct. The review could discuss in more detail what are the
potential biases in reporting mortality, and why these are minor in
comparison to biases in reported diarrheal illness. If there is any
evidence or research supporting this claim it would be useful to report
it. For example, one reason why the evidence suggests that reported
mortality is very likely to be an unbiased measure (e.g., Wood et al.,
2008)[@nsp88sjixk8] is that it is very unlikely that a child's carers
might misremember or misreport it, whereas they may well do for a common
illness like diarrhea (Sharma Waddington et al., 2023)[@na5xzxm1kuq].

The risk-of-bias ratings reported in the supplementary materials range
between 4 and 7 out of a total possible score of 11. We note that
evidence suggests it is not appropriate to determine overall bias using
quality scales (Jüni et al., 1999)[@nc40v4g6d6t]. Authors of critical
appraisal tools have instead shown that it is possible to assess overall
bias based on transparent decision criteria (e.g., Eldridge et al.,
2016[@n8plcuon0k4]; Sterne et al., 2016)[@nkrx0ptv1tp]. The review
should comment on the implications of the risk-of-bias assessment for
the confidence in the findings of the evidence base.

## **Meta-analysis conduct**

> *Meta-analysis and pooling subgroups*

Regarding the meta-analysis that was conducted, the review reports an
overall pooled effect together with a sub-group effect for chlorination.
However, the review could also have reported pooled effects for
*filtration*, where there were three estimates. Perhaps the reviewers
felt that the Peletz et al. (2012)[@nzvz1hn3aoa] study, conducted among
immunocompromised groups, was not representative of general contexts;
but we note that, even if that study was excluded, meta-analytical
pooling can be undertaken provided there is more than one independent
effect size.

> *Heterogeneity; Measuring adherence*

However, a key purpose of meta-analysis is not just to estimate a pooled
effect, but also to explain heterogeneity in estimates across studies.
The review conducted analysis of adherence and length of follow-up,
among other factors, finding no strong association between mortality and
adherence, and a negative association for follow-up length -- that is,
there was no significant effect of interventions on mortality in
childhood for follow-ups beyond 52 weeks, as has also been found for
diarrhea morbidity (Waddington et al., 2009)[@n9oeqvguex3]. It is very
difficult to measure adherence accurately since it is impossible to
prevent populations from drinking other (unimproved) water sources, and
because other disease transmission mechanisms may be more or less
important in highly contaminated environments. For example, when
sanitation is classified as unimproved, so most people are openly
defecating or sharing toilet facilities with people from other
households and/or using facilities that do not adequately remove excreta
from the environment, the primary sources of pathogens are fecally
contaminated fingers, fields, floors, flies, food and fomites, as well
as fluids if drinking water becomes contaminated too (Wagner and Lanoix,
1958)[@nhfcap06cz6]. Perhaps drinking water is particularly susceptible
to contamination in such circumstances, so HWT might be effective if you
can get people that openly defecate to practise consistent water
treatment and protection through intensive promotion or inline drinking
water provision. On a similar note, the review did not discuss the
interaction of the interventions with baseline environmental
characteristics. The sensitivity analysis considered the baseline
prevalence of diarrhea, and the review observed that the meta-analysis
was not sufficiently powered to conduct a disaggregated analysis.
However, the review could have examined or discussed how the results
might differ in different contexts in greater detail, since this has
been a major concern in the literature.

> *Bayesian meta-analysis issues; strong differences from frequentist
> results; generalizability*

It is increasingly common to use Bayesian meta-analysis, an approach
first proposed by Paul Hunter (2009)[@nt5s4wkexut] for HWT using
empirical bias correction factors. The review states that the mean
effect estimated by the meta-analysis is specific to the sample
considered (p.14). This is only partly true. The review considered
between-study heterogeneity at the review level, and aimed to predict
study effectiveness beyond the sample considered, as measured by the
Bayesian uncertainty analysis. However, in the Bayesian meta-analysis,
the posterior estimates for individual studies differed from the
frequentist model, sometimes considerably; for example, the estimate for
Luby et al. (2006)[@nhbmksy980l] shifts from a whopping OR=23.88
(95%CI=0.08, 7240) to OR=0.74 (95%CI=0.37, 1.49). It would be useful for
readers, who may be less familiar with Bayesian meta-analysis, if the
review can explain why these differences are so large.

## **Systematic review and meta-analysis reporting**

The review presents the numbers of deaths in treatment and control
groups for all of the studies included in the meta-analysis in Table S3.
This has required great effort on the part of the reviewers, and stands
to be useful to researchers working on the effectiveness of
interventions to reduce mortality in childhood for years to come.

> *Metadata on intervention contexts*

However, it is standard practice in systematic reviews and meta-analyses
on WASH topics to report transparently on the populations, interventions
and the counterfactual water supply and sanitation conditions too (e.g.,
Fewtrell and Colford, 2004[@n41xtakuyub]; Arnold and Colford,
2007[@nz5bnu2egjf]; Waddington et al., 2009[@nrmjionv38v]; Wolf et al.,
2022[@n0o60edbcan]; Sharma Waddington et al., 2023)[@nwvj23ve7g6]. For
example, the reader wants to know the interventions evaluated, the
circumstances in which the evaluations were conducted, the types of
populations covered, such as whether any were from immunocompromised
groups, and the degree of movement up the drinking water and hygiene
ladders afforded by the intervention. This information should be readily
accessible, very preferably in the main text.

> *Report standalone vs joint interventions*

The front section of the review does not clarify whether the studies
included were standalone water treatment and protection interventions or
whether they were implemented alongside other interventions. It is
common for WASH interventions to be implemented in conjunction with
other treatments, which also may have independent or interactive effects
on morbidity and mortality. For example, as noted in the supplementary
materials, several included study arms were of multicomponent
interventions where HWT was provided alongside cookstoves (Kirby et al.,
2019)[@nf83cgns7b4] or sanitation and hygiene (Humphrey et al.,
2019)[@n0cc25beozw]. One chlorine trial incorporated food hygiene
education (Semenza et al., 1998)[@n527xm40xsc]. Other studies had
hygiene and sanitation co-intervention arms that were excluded (e.g.
Luby et al., 2018; Null et al., 2018), although the review states they
were incorporated in sensitivity analysis. This point changes the
interpretation of the results, in some cases in important ways. For
example, since the focus of the review is all-cause mortality, it should
be clearer which of the studies combined HWT with software and hardware
that can affect children's exposure to enteric or respiratory infection
such as washing with soap and water, food hygiene or indoor cook-stoves.
The conclusions may need to be qualified by observing that the results
should be interpreted as approximations of the effects of 'water
treatment and protection', if 'water treatment and protection'
interventions were implemented as multicomponent packages including
other activities affecting morbidity and mortality in childhood.

> *Reporting random effects weights, etc.*

We have an additional point about the meta-analysis as it was reported.
It is standard practice to report the random effects weight of each
study in the meta-analysis, as well as relative and absolute
between-study heterogeneity (I-squared and Tau-squared) for all analyses
conducted including sub-groups. Having a low value of heterogeneity
helps the reader understand if the pooled effect is likely to be valid
across the sample of studies included in the meta-analysis. Values of
Tau-squared are reported at the overall review level, but weights and
sub-group heterogeneity statistics can be reported transparently in
forest plots.

> *Publication bias; Power calculation approaches*

Regarding the publication bias analysis, which provides a rare example
where small study effects were not measured, we believe this is because
most of the studies were not designed to measure mortality as a primary
or secondary outcome. As noted by the reviewers, there may still be
publication bias present (for example, mortality data from 29 studies
were not obtainable, as discussed below). However, we are less convinced
by the approach used to assess the statistical power of the
meta-analysis. The review added null results (the post-hoc simulation on
page 4) to the observed results and checked whether the meta-analysis
still found a statistically significant effect. We wondered if post-hoc
power calculations would be a simpler approach to address the same
question. Perhaps the review could calculate the minimum detectable
effect size or power of the meta-analysis as a function of the number of
studies and see whether it is sufficiently powered to detect an effect
size in the presence of publication bias.

## **Cost-effectiveness analysis**

*Choice of overall sample estimates; uncertainty in cost-effectiveness*

Although it was not a primary aspect of our review (as requested by
Unjournal editors), we also had concerns about the cost-effectiveness
analysis. Firstly, the analysis used the Bayesian meta-analysis estimate
across the whole sample of studies, including filtration, spring
protection and solar disinfection. However, since two of the
cost-effectiveness estimates directly concerned chlorination, it would
seem more appropriate to use the pooled meta-analytic effects for
*chlorination* alone in those cost-effectiveness analyses. Secondly, the
review does not provide uncertainty estimates for the cost-effectiveness
estimates with respect to either the confidence intervals on
intervention effectiveness or sensitivity analyses to different cost
scenarios or other assumptions (e.g., adherence rates).

> *Limitations of the WHO GDP threshold for decisionmaking*

The review also made frequent use of the WHO GDP threshold. We note that
many commentators within and outside the World Health Organization (WHO)
have expressed their scepticism about this threshold and its use in
decision-making (see for example
[this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27994285/) document for a review
of debates on the GDP threshold within and without WHO). The GDP
threshold is still widely used today, and the review is not exceptional
in this. However, since the threshold has been criticized in many ways,
we suggest that the review reports the limitations of using the
threshold for decision-making, and explain how the threshold should be
interpreted for decision-making purposes in this particular context.

## **Implications for policy**

> *Lack of (evidence of) representativeness*

The review states that "the studies included in the meta-analysis are
broadly representative of the settings in which policymakers might
implement water treatment programs" (p.15). It is hard to believe that
18 studies could represent the contextual variability one would find
within and across countries and contexts within countries, especially
when one considers that 14 of the 18 included studies were conducted in
middle-income countries. It would be useful to understand who are the
policymakers that would find this sample representative. Site-selection
biases operate, whereby research sites selected for trials are those
where there is the greatest contamination of drinking water and
diarrhoea disease burden (Sharma Waddington et al., 2023)[@nxh95tkzfnd].
Perhaps it should be accepted that the sample is not representative of
contextual variability. But if it is representative, we suggest adding
some supporting evidence.

> *Routes of transmission; pathogens*

It is important to understand the different routes of infection
transmission, and which particular diarrheagenic pathogens drinking
water treatment and protection can address in typical disease
circumstances, in order to understand the relevance and generalizability
of the findings for policy. Endemic diarrhea in L&MIC contexts is
understood to be caused by exposure to viruses (especially rotavirus),
protozoa (especially cryptosporidium) and bacteria (especially *E.Coli*
and Shigella) (Liu et al., 2017)[@nko40agoz12]. However, water treatment
may not adequately address faecal contamination if the treatment
technology itself is not efficacious in combating disease (Arnold and
Colford, 2007)[@nikpvn4adn1]. An example would be filtration, which is
efficacious against bacteria and larger protozoans, but less so against
common viruses like rotavirus. It also requires safe storage for
sustained efficacy as there is no residual protection after water has
been filtered. Chlorination kills bacteria and most viruses, and has the
advantage of providing residual protection. But, in usual doses,
chlorine is much less effective against protozoans like cryptosporidium
and Giardia, common causes of severe diarrhea in low-income contexts,
especially, but not only, among immunocompromised groups such as those
living with HIV (Abubakar et al., 2007)[@nru6ez4f152].

> *Sustainability (persistence); Hawthorne effects*

In order to understand generalizability of the findings from a review of
behaviour change interventions, one also needs to understand if desired
behaviours are practised and sustained, such as whether sufficient
protective agents are applied to treat drinking water or adequate
personal hygiene practised at the point of use so that contaminated
hands or utensils are not placed in drinking water storage containers.
One aspect of this is to assess rates of adherence and sustainability,
as done in the review. The review did not find a significant association
between adherence and mortality, which is likely due to the different
measures of adherence used in the literature and the problems in
measuring adherence to drinking water technology more generally, as
discussed above. The only consistent relationship that was observed
appeared to be the limited effectiveness of HWT after 6-12 months of
follow-up. Factors associated with dis-adoption include users disliking
the odour and taste of chlorinated water.

Much of the evidence on water treatment has come from RCTs conducted at
zero or negligible financial costs to participants, with frequent
follow-up by outsiders and disruption of normal domestic routines (the
'mzungu effect') (Waddington et al., 2009)[@ntqgljvxhvd]. There is
therefore a high potentiality in these studies for Hawthorne effects,
where being observed leads to greater efforts to adhere to treatment
protocols, favouring the treatment group in unblinded trials. This bias
is especially likely to occur when follow-up and measurement occurs
frequently, as it does in many evaluations of HWT interventions. For
example, in analysis that includes many of the studies used in the
review, Pickering et al. (2019: e1143)[@nwfkw3tjh9j] reported that
"virtually all the evidence that promotion of... point-of-use water
treatment with chlorine or flocculant disinfectant reduce diarrhea come
from studies that had daily to fortnightly contact between the behaviour
change promoter and study participant". Hence, one useful analysis that
the review could perform would be to examine the association between
odds ratios and frequencies of follow-up visits by investigators. When
there are lots of visits, the findings of the studies are unreliable
guides to the effectiveness of real-world programmes that do not have
frequent follow-ups, yet require participants to undertake behavioural
modifications where children's carers must always treat household
drinking water while also ensuring that children never consume water
from unsafe sources.

## **Implications for reporting of RCTs and meta-analyses**

> *Need better RCT reporting standards in development economics, esp.
> CONSORT participant flow diagrams*

In our opinion, what the review clearly highlights is that current
standards for reporting of RCTs, especially in development economics,
are not fit for purpose. Reputable journals publishing field trials in
health require that CONSORT participant flow diagrams are reported,
which show numbers of individual participants by study arm from
recruitment of clusters and individuals within clusters, through
follow-ups, together with important reasons for attrition like death
(Moher et al., 1998)[@n9h3wrppxr5]. Without this information it is
difficult to assess important threats to validity in these studies,
which might occur due to problems in design and conduct. It is not
sufficient to publish data openly, as many economics journals require,
in order to assess them. For example, a key aspect of the internal
validity in cluster-RCTs is knowledge about when and how individual
participants were recruited, so that total and differential selection
bias into the study from joiners can be assessed. The same follows for
selection bias out of the study (attrition), although this is more
commonly evaluated. It can also be useful to know who dropped out of the
study between enrolment and randomization stages to evaluate external
validity.

A recent survey by Chirgwin et al. (2021)[@nf99gol4lxr] of WASH impact
evaluations in L&MICs found that only half of trials in health had
reported a study participant level CONSORT diagram, whereas no RCTs of
WASH in economics had done so. 3ie has published CONSORT standards for
RCTs in economics (Bose, 2010)[@nzqsot1owk1]. What the review
demonstrates is that this lack of participant flow reporting is
extremely costly. Had the participant flows been reported transparently,
there would have been less need for the reviewers to contact RCT authors
to obtain the attrition data on all-cause mortality in childhood.[^3]
The reviewers themselves noted this process was "time-consuming... and
led to the loss of some data that was once available but is no longer
available" (p.16), since there were 29 studies whose authors responded
that the mortality data had not been collected, or had been collected
but were no longer available, or who did not respond at all.

> *Reasons for previous lack of analysis of mortality, solutions*

The review suggests that the reason why there has been hitherto limited
analysis of mortality is because multiple testing of hypotheses prevents
researchers from analysing the impact of the interventions on mortality.
We are not convinced about this since the lack of reporting of mortality
data is more likely due to the use of small samples, the difficulty of
collecting mortality data, and apparently the lack of familiarity with
reporting mortality data. Hence requiring these data be analysed as part
of pre-analysis plans is unlikely to address the problem sufficiently.
We believe a more effective solution would provide incentives for
authors of RCTs to report participant flow diagrams, as are done in
other fields, including RCTs measuring the impacts of HWT on diarrhea
published in health journals. RCTs are costly to undertake financially
and often require substantial time engagement by participants, so there
are strong ethical and, as shown in the review, practical reasons for
authors to report participant flows, and for reputable journals and
commissioners to require them to do so.

There are similar standards for reporting systematic reviews and
meta-analyses, which we discussed above, relating to the publication of
protocols, reporting of deviations from protocol and adherence to PRISMA
conduct and reporting standards. A key purpose of a systematic review
protocol is to help reviewers avoid making results-based choices
(consciously or otherwise). This does not mean that deviations from
protocol are not allowed, just that they are explained.

> *COI issues/statements*

Finally, we believe the positionality of the reviewers is not reported
satisfactorily. It would be useful to know, for example, if the included
RCTs conducted by the reviewers were appraised by different authors.
Furthermore, one of the reviewers is a Board member of Evidence Action,
the campaigning NGO that provided data on which two of the
cost-effectiveness scenario estimates are based, and another is a
principal investigator of two studies that led to the organisation's
earliest campaigns (Drinking Water Chlorination and Deworm the World).
We might expect these associations to be mentioned in reviewer
declarations due to the potential for conflicts of interest. For
example, UKRI states: "the existence of an actual, perceived or
potential conflict of interest does not necessarily imply wrongdoing on
anyone's part. However, any private, personal or commercial interests
which give rise to such a conflict of interest must be recognised,
disclosed appropriately and either eliminated or properly managed.
Reporting, recording and managing potential conflicts effectively... can
help to generate public trust and confidence."[^4]

# Evaluator details

1.  How long have you been in this field?

    -   Sharma Waddington has worked in the field of international
        development for 23 years, and in the field of policymaking and
        evidence based policy for 20 years. Masset has worked in the
        field of evidence based policy for 25 years. The combined total
        is around 48 years.

2.  How many proposals and papers have you evaluated?

    -   Since we have both worked as academics and grant funders for
        impact evaluations like RCTs, systematic reviews and
        meta-analyses for a combined total of approximately 50 years, we
        think we have evaluated over 250 each, so perhaps in excess of
        500 in total.

[^1]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^2]: The reviewers noted that "We assessed the meta-analysis under
    PRISMA 2020 guidelines (19), provided in the Supplementary Material"
    (p.17). This was not available in the supplement at the time of our
    review.

[^3]: CONSORT standards require that important reasons for attrition be
    given by trial arm, which would usually be expected to include
    death, but not necessarily death in childhood. A number of included
    studies that did faithfully report participant flows indicated the
    total number of deaths by treatment arm across all age groups only,
    requiring the reviewers to obtain the numbers of deaths in childhood
    through author correspondence.
