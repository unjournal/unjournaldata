# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

Section 6 of the paper provides the most crucial remarks for policy
designers and practitioners. I would further highlight three points. \
\
First, the paper's evidence on substitution versus complementarity is
vital: a one-standard-deviation increase in university patents reduces
corporate patenting by 51%, underscoring the need to carefully calibrate
technology-transfer and licensing policies. \
\
Second, embodied human capital in the form of PhD graduates plays a
powerful complementary role---each one-standard deviation rise in
relevant doctorates yields a 53% boost in firm patents---highlighting
the high leverage of targeted doctoral- training initiatives. \
\
Third, regional innovation strategies and university--industry
partnership programs must balance the benefits of widespread technology
diffusion against the risk of competitive displacement among incumbent
firms.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^5] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

Before reading this paper, I would have assumed that public knowledge
and corporate innovation were largely complementary, with firmsʼ
absorptive capacity determining who benefits from publicly available
research. In that view, only frontier firms---or those with sufficient
in-house expertise---could effectively incorporate external knowledge.
Instead, this study shows that an increase in university patents
actually crowds out private patenting, challenging the assumption of
universal complementarity. \
\
That finding raises a broader question... \[moved to answer to question
IV\]

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^6] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

I recommend adding the robustness check I mentioned in my report:
implementing a difference-in-differences identification strategy. Iʼm
not suggesting it would necessarily outperform the current IV approach,
but it would offer the authors a valuable alternative perspective. A
well-designed Dif-in-Dif should be feasible in this context and would
help verify whether the results hold under a different identification
scheme.

It may not change the results at all---in which case, it would simply
robustify the paperʼs existing findings. If the results do change, that
would open a different line of inquiry. Either way, this suggestion is
hypothetical at this stage but could strengthen the study's
contribution.[^7]

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^8] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

\[Copying from the answer to question 2\]

> That finding raises a broader question: is private innovation output
> more important to aggregate economic growth than the underlying public
> knowledge? Based on historical breakthroughs tied to basic research,
> one could argue that the non-commercialized, foundational discoveries

# Written report[^9]

### From "Research Quality (Additional Comments)"

The paper develops a systematic framework for analysing how public
science capital affects corporate R&D, leveraging rich firm level data
and extensive robustness checks to support credible causal inference. My
main question is whether this instrumental variables strategy offers
clear advantages over a difference-indifferences design.

The paper investigates how three components of public science---
abstract knowledge (publications), human capital (PhD scientists), and
public inventions (university patents)---affect corporate R&D,
distinguishing upstream (research) from downstream (invention)
activities within a simple profit-maximization framework that posits
public knowledge and human capital lower the marginal cost of internal
invention while public inventions may either serve as inputs or compete
with firm-generated inventions. \
\
Drawing on a novel firm-level panel of U.S. publicly traded,
R&D-performing firms (1980--2015) linked to Compustat, PatentsView,
Dimensions grant acknowledgments, ProQuest dissertations, and the AMWS
directory, the authors measure firm-relevant public science via
exposure-weighted stocks of non-corporate publications,
dissertation--patent textual similarity, and university patents. To
address endogeneity, they construct Bartik-style instruments based on
exogenous shifts in federal agency R&D budgets--- predicted by the
partisan composition of House and Senate appropriations
subcommittees---interacted with firm-specific exposure shares. \
\
They find that "pure" public knowledge (journal publications) has little
to no effect on corporate patents, publications, or hiring of top
scientists, indicating limited non-rival spillovers; by contrast, a
one-standard-deviation increase in relevant PhD dissertations boosts
firm patents by \~53%, publications by \~22%, and AMWS scientist
employment by \~9%, while a similar rise in university patents reduces
firm patents by \~51%, publications by \~33%, AMWS hiring by \~8%, and
lowers profits---evidence that public inventions largely substitute for
and compete with corporate R&D. Technology-frontier firms benefit more
from human capital and less from public inventions, whereas follower
firms---especially in the life sciences---are more responsive to public
inventions and knowledge. \
\
These results challenge the notion of public science as a pure public
good, highlighting that only excludable, rivalrous outputs (people and
patents) drive private innovation, and they underscore the need to
consider the competitive effects of university commercialization. My
report applauds the paperʼs rigorous causal strategy and rich data
integration while suggesting robustness checks---such as a
difference-in-differences design---and clarifications on model
specifications (e.g., inclusion of level dummies in interaction
regressions, treatment of firm versus time subscripts, and the potential
role of an international knowledge frontier)---refinements that could
further enhance \[and strengthen\] insights into the relationship
between public investment and corporate innovation.

### 1. Claims, Strength, and Characterization of Evidence

The paper clearly states its primary research question: How do different
aspects of public science influence corporate innovation activities? The
approach is grounded in a thorough theoretical framework and supported
by strong empirical evidence. The empirical strategy addresses potential
endogeneity bias between corporate innovation activities and public
knowledge, primarily by leveraging political shifts affecting agency R&D
budgets. Although tackling (unobserved) endogeneity bias is an extremely
challenging task in economics research, the authors\' attempt
demonstrates a level of credibility that likely outweighs the potential
limitations of the chosen approach. Providing results that establish
causal inference adds significant value to the paper and strengthens the
robustness of its empirical findings.

*Assessment (Claims and Characterization of Evidence): 85/100*

### 2. Methods: Justification, Reasonableness, Validity, Robustness

The paper applies an instrumental variables (IV) estimation to identify
the causal impacts of public science on corporate innovation.
Specifically, it uses a Bartik-style shift-share IV, where the "shifts"
are changes in federal agency R&D budgets, expected to represent
exogenous shocks driven mainly by the political composition of Congress.
The "shares" are firm-specific exposures based on past patenting
activity, publications, or dissertation overlaps. The validity of this
instrument depends on the assumption that political shifts in R&D
funding are exogenous to firm-specific innovation shocks. Admittedly,
this is a reasonable assumption within this context, although the
presence of weak identification might persist, particularly for large
firms, especially considering spatial dimensions that may be
interrelated with the determination of the federal budget. The authors
are aware of this concern and address it by controlling for potential
firm size effects through the inclusion of lagged R&D stock or annual
sales in all relevant specifications. This is convincing and sufficient
to argue that the presented results are not significantly biased,
especially given the inherent challenges of identifying causal
relationships in models of this kind.

Nonetheless, I would like to suggest that the authors consider whether a
difference-in-differences (DiD) approach could also be used to address
the endogeneity bias between public knowledge and in-house innovation
efforts. I do not claim that a DiD approach would necessarily outperform
the strategy they have already employed, but it could serve as an
additional robustness check. For example, one could identify a subset of
firms more exposed to changes in public science funding (e.g., firms
active in fields funded by certain agencies) and another subset less
exposed, and then compare their innovation outcomes before and after the
shocks, assuming the timing of R&D budget changes is exogenous. From the
top of my head, one could think of firms heavily linked to NASA
subfields versus those linked to the Department of Agriculture. This
could be an interesting extension if the firm panel allows for such an
analysis.

In any case, the current identification strategy has strong merits and
mitigates endogeneity concerns in a reasonable and convincing manner.

### 3. Overall Assessment: Contribution to Knowledge and Practice[^10]

This paper presents a significant and well-executed empirical study
examining how public science, in its various dimensions, affects
corporate research and development (R&D). The authors distinguish
between three key components of public science: abstract knowledge
(e.g., scientific publications), human capital (e.g., PhD scientists),
and public inventions (e.g., university patents). Their findings that
corporate R&D is driven more by embodied knowledge in human capital and
inventions than by abstract knowledge itself offers important insights
for science policy and innovation management.

The study contributes to our understanding of how knowledge transfer
mechanisms operate in practice and challenges conventional wisdom that
treats public science primarily as a non-rival, purely spillover-driven
input to private innovation. By leveraging firm-level exposure to
exogenous shifts in federal R&D budgets tied to political subcommittee
composition, the paper advances causal inference in this domain. Its
nuanced implications---for example, the crowding-out effect of public
invention on corporate R&D---are particularly relevant in an era of
increasing university-industry partnerships and policy attention to
innovation ecosystems.

*Assessment : 90/100*

### 4. Logic and Communication

The goals and questions of the paper are clearly articulated: the
authors seek to disentangle the distinct effects of public knowledge,
human capital, and public inventions on corporate innovation activities.
Key concepts are well defined, and the framework guiding the empirical
analysis is transparent and logically developed.

Nonetheless, I have some specific queries that I would like to raise.

\[4.1\][^11] In Equation 3.1, is the variable r a stock variable
(representing cumulative knowledge) or just a flow variable? I am aware
that later in the paper, the authors treat public knowledge as a stock
variable using the perpetual inventory method, but in the theoretical
setup, this is not made explicit. It might be useful for the authors to
clarify this point clearly from the very beginning.

\[4.2\] Additionally, regarding the function phi in the profit
maximization problem: could it be subject to constant returns to scale
(CRS) instead of diminishing returns to scale (DRS)? The authors
implicitly assume that the productivity of investment falls with respect
to both human capital and public knowledge. This is my understanding
based on the setup of the model in Section 3.1, unless I am missing
something. While this is a conventional assumption, would it not also be
possible to allow for CRS or even increasing returns to scale (IRS) if
the use of new knowledge capital (either internal or external to the
firm) generates spillovers that lead to new ideas at a constant or
increasing rate? In other words, is there any role for unintended
spillovers in the model that could counteract the diminishing returns
assumption? This is just a question and may not be crucial for the
modelling approach, but it could be worth considering or clarifying.

\[4.3\] Furthermore, I was wondering whether the authors included the
level dummy for high ability in the regressions of Table 10, since they
are using the interaction term between public investment and human
capital. Isn't it the case that these regressions should also include
the dummy variable itself?

\[4.4\] Regarding this point, do we need to report the overall effects
of the variables of interest (public investment and human capital) in
Tables 10 and 11 etc, given that they are interacted with industry fixed
effects, especially in Table 11? Also, why does the dependent variable
in Tables 10, 11, and 12 include only the time subscript but not the
firm subscript? Are we missing something here?

\[4.5\] In Section 3.2.4, the authors distinguish between leaders and
followers. While the paper specifically focuses on the U.S., I would
like to raise a question about whether there could also be a role for a
global frontier instead of just a national frontier, as well as the
potential impact of international public knowledge capital. The authors
have deliberately excluded non-U.S. PhDs from the empirical analysis.
This choice merits further justification. Is this decision conceptually
meaningful? Is the influence of international public knowledge capital
on U.S. corporations truly negligible? Admittedly, U.S. firms are
typically positioned at the international technological frontier, but
there might be sectors where the U.S. lags behind other countries. Have
the authors considered these possibilities?

Overall, the central point of the paper---that there is a potential
trade-off between public invention as a competitor versus as an
input---is carefully and convincingly developed.

*Assessment: 83/1004*

### 5. Replicability, Reproducibility, and Data Integrity

The paper demonstrates strong adherence to reproducibility standards.
The dataset--- DISCERN---is publicly available through Zenodo, and the
variable construction is extensively documented in appendices. The use
of machine learning (SPECTER) for textual similarity analysis between
patents and PhD dissertations is clearly explained and appropriately
validated.

The authors also conduct multiple robustness checks and use alternative
operationalizations of their key variables (e.g., alternative
definitions of public invention using SPECTER-based similarity). Data
integrity appears solid, with comprehensive coverage of firm-level R&D
activity over a long time span (1986-2015) and linkage across several
high-quality data sources, including Compustat, PatentsView, Dimensions,
and ProQuest. I recommend that the authors enhance reproducibility by
releasing anonymized intermediate datasets and code snippets for key
transformations, and by archiving their data‐processing scripts (e.g.,
on GitHub). This would enable other scholars to leverage the same data
pipeline for related research in innovation, human capital, and public
knowledge.

*Assessment: 90/100*

### 6. Relevance to Global Priorities and Usefulness for Practitioners

This paper offers valuable insights for both policymakers and
practitioners concerned with the real-world impacts of public investment
in science. The finding of this research that public inventions may
substitute for internal R&D---especially among follower firms---has
practical implications for how universities license technologies and for
how governments design innovation policies.

The focus on firm heterogeneity, such as differences between technology
frontier and follower firms, adds depth and policy relevance.
Quantitative estimates (e.g., a one standard deviation increase in
relevant public invention reduces firm patents by 51%) provide
actionable metrics for prioritization. By highlighting that only
embodied knowledge (in people or patents) translates into corporate R&D
investment, the study guides more effective knowledge transfer
strategies.

In sum, this paper represents a rigorous, transparent, and
policy-relevant contribution to the field of corporate R&D investment
and public knowledge capital. It challenges the commonly used assumption
that there are spillovers from public investment in knowledge,
systematically exploring the hypothesis of whether there is
complementarity or substitutability between public investment and
in-house innovation activity. This approach provides a more refined
understanding of how public investment in research shapes private-sector
innovation, which remains among the most important sources of economic
growth.
