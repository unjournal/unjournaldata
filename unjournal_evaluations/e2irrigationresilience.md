# Abstract 

One of the article's strengths is offering a longer time horizon of
analysis of smallholder irrigation, which gives insights beyond
localized case studies or pilot plots. Another value is that the authors
connect spatial data across water, agriculture and nutrition, to provide
insight beyond water efficiency or yield gains. The analysis on
longer-term livelihood outcomes may be beneficial for potential
decision-making on irrigation policy. \
\
However, the article has shortcomings in terms of causal factors and
control areas for comparison. For example, is the differences in
nutritional outcomes related to improved income, increased household
consumption of own produce, changes in dietary behavior, market
development, or other factors? Context-specific information on the
causal pathways are critical for investment and program design.

# Claim identification and assessment [^4]

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^5] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

There is a correlation between an irrigation investment using pumped
water in an area of Mali and improved nutritional status of children in
the same area.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^6] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

The basic proposition is credible, but the assumptions about causal
relationship are less convincing.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^7] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

The work would have benefited from a comparative or control, and from
much more in-depth social science through a targeted nutritional survey
(that considers other indicators of nutrition beyond caloric intake), in
depth interviews, and project tracing to understand other investments
and contextual factors that may contribute to causation.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^8] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

Irrigation usually - but not always - has a positive impact on
nutrition, but can have negative impacts on water quality, health,
gender relations, among others. In short, the design of irrigation
schemes matters to outcomes. Even within the paper, one type of
irrigation had little to no impact and one type had positive impact
(correlation observed). Without understanding the multiple causal
factors in this context, an irrigation investment may not have the same
(assumed) positive impact. No conclusions can be drawn from this study
that would enable quantification of nutritional improvements from
another irrigation pumping scheme in rice. In some cases, such
investments may lead to maladaptation, outmigration, inequality, and
declining health.

# Written report

The paper holds value in advancing knowledge on the linkages between
irrigation investments and nutritional (caloric) outcomes. The
literature and the relevant datasets, particularly for the Global South,
are scant. The authors used the tools available to push the discussion
forward on a couple of very key issues in the West Africa (Sahelian)
region. Correlations were observed with statistical significance between
investments in irrigation and nutrition and child development and
conflict incidents. The paper applies available tools appropriately and
makes efforts in multi-methods, interdisciplinary research. In this
ways, the paper is a good contribution to the small but important
literature on irrigation and nutrition.\
\
That said, some claims and assumptions of the paper should be considered
further. These include:

-   The images provided appear to show that the irrigation areas are
    fairly contained, i.e., there does not appear to be irrigated
    extensification around the project areas. Given that farmer-led
    irrigation is often undercounted, it is important to use the tools
    to try to identify the extent to which the irrigation area expanded
    by farmers' own investments. This may or may not be significant for
    establishing causation of the nutrition and conflict outcomes.

```{=html}

```
-   The difference between pumped and flooded areas suggests that key
    causal factors are being missed. The differences are not
    sufficiently addressed and left without further analysis.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Explanations for the observed, statistical outcomes are largely
    socio-economic, but the analysis relies on some FGDs and broad
    surveys that are likely insufficient. The survey data used is not
    detailed for nutrition; the surveys tend to use recall on household
    caloric intake rather than important nutrition indicators, such as
    dietary diversity for different members of the household. The same
    surveys are also household level, which makes the conclusions
    related to intra-household relations curious. As the paper
    acknowledges, recall may be an issue, notably on the low reporting
    on illness.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Authors attribute household nutritional improvements to increased
    production, particularly of rice. The actual causal relationship is
    most likely more nuanced. More rice may support more income which
    may in turn support household purchase of foods for increased
    dietary diversity. This granularity of nutritional outcome will not
    be captured by the surveys used and therefore, requires the authors
    to make some guesses.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Factors that could be contributors in addition to irrigation
    infrastructure are not considered, such as added investments or
    programs in infrastructure, capacity, and education by the major
    irrigation development donor or government. Irrigation investment
    are often accompanied by programs that could also improve
    livelihoods

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Authors acknowledge spillover is possible but it is not clear how
    they address that without comparison or control groups. Generally,
    FGDs are not adequate to compensate for the lack of a control group,
    particularly when the findings being emphasized are statistical.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Explanations on reduced conflict seem unsubstantiated. The reasoning
    that follows correlation may be described as best guess. Other
    investments may have been implemented in the area that affected
    outcomes for conflict incidents. For example, irrigation scheme
    development often occurs in parallel with development of water
    points for sanitation and domestic use, engagement with and
    sometimes payments to local authorities, increased security of land
    use rights, and increased general security to ensure protection of
    infrastructure and production area. To narrow the explanation to the
    irrigation investment is to oversimplify what is most likely a
    nuanced causal relationship. Comparative or control cases would
    strengthen the validity of the conclusions, as would more in-depth
    social science beyond FGDs.

Despite some questions on the conclusions drawn by the authors, the
paper nonetheless offers insights based on the correlations. The
conclusions as they stand could be detrimental to future programs and
practice without more nuance.
