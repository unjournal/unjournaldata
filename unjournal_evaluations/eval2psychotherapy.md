# Abstract 

This is a high quality paper that extensively studies the effects of
therapy. I make a few small suggestions for analyses to explore the
economic effects and the perceived efficacy of therapy.

# Written report

This paper studies the long-run effects of therapy on depression, using
two randomized trials of psychotherapy in India. The main result is that
therapy reduces the likelihood of depression by 11 percentage points,
five years after treatment. The evidence for this claim is strong,
coming from follow-up data on randomized controlled trials with no
evidence of problems in balance or attrition; deviations from the
pre-analysis plan are clearly explained. The paper investigates the
mechanisms of the causal effect, studies economic effects, and elicits
beliefs about the perceived efficacy of therapy. The focus on long-run
effects is important for informing policy.

The authors find no effect of therapy on economic outcomes like
employment and earnings. This is explained by the sample being mostly
women combined with social norms in India preventing female labor market
participation. This leaves open the possibility that therapy affects
economic outcomes for men, which is not tested. From Table A.1, there
are roughly 70 men in the HAP trial follow-up (N=391 and proportion
female of 0.82), which could be a large enough sample to test for an
interaction effect. The authors note that the economic outcomes are not
corrected for multiple-hypotheses testing and should be viewed as
exploratory, so further exploratory work on the economic effects for men
seems appropriate.

The authors report that therapy increased perceived effectiveness of
therapy in both trials, despite the THPP trial being ineffective. One
explanation, proposed by the authors, is that patients are not able to
distinguish correlation from causation. Depression was reduced in the
treatment and control groups in THPP at the same rate, presumably due to
a common cause: pregnancy and childbirth (the sample is pregnant women).
Hence, because their depression improved while receiving therapy,
treated patients mistakenly believe that therapy caused the reduction in
depression.

Since the treatment group beliefs about efficacy are actually higher in
THPP than HAP, we might think that experimenter demand effects are
playing a role. This is consistent with THPP being a longer trial than
HAP 1 (6-14 sessions over 7-12 months in THPP compared to 6-8 weekly
sessions in HAP), and hence being more likely to leave participants with
fond memories of the trial. However, the evidence is mixed, since demand
effects predict higher perceived efficacy in the treatment group
relative to the control group, which is true for beliefs about efficacy
at 1 year and 5 years after treatment, but does not hold for 3 months
after treatment (Figure 4).[^2]

Given the importance of understanding how perceptions of therapy affect
take-up, it seems worthwhile to dig deeper into these results. The
authors test for heterogeneous treatment effects for the effect on
depression (Table A.3), and could repeat this analysis for perceived
efficacy.[^3] For example, how does the effect of therapy on perceived
efficacy vary by baseline expected efficacy?

The authors claim that \$7 per month of depression averted is
"remarkably cost-effective", but it is not clear how to place this
number in context. For example, it would be useful to know the
cost-effectiveness of other therapy interventions. Moreover, it would
also be useful to compare therapy against a cash transfer benchmark.
Similarly, the discussion of policy-relevance could be expanded. How
generalizable are the effects of a basic therapy like behavioral
activation (which encourages engaging in enjoyable activities)? Do the
effects reported here depend on characteristics specific to India?

The authors collected expert forecasts using the Social Science
Prediction Platform. As shown in Figure 8, the interquartile range of
experts' predictions contains the actual estimate in only 3 out of 6
outcomes. This is beyond the scope of this paper, but for knowing how
seriously to take these forecasts, it would be helpful to see a track
record or some form of validation.

[^1]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^2]: One possible typo: Figure 4 refers to "time after enrollment",
    while Section 5 in the text states that the time horizon is
    calculated from the completion of treatment.

[^3]: The notes under Table A.3 are a bit confusing; footnote 22
    clarifies that it is based on an interaction regression. It would be
    clearer to show the regression equation.
