# Abstract 

Weaver et al. evaluate the first randomized trial of UCTs in India,
examining impacts on a battery of measures of household spending,
consumption, nutrition, and child growth and development. Strengths
include scale, comprehensiveness, and rigorous analysis of treatment
effects and effect heterogeneity. Critiques center around interpretation
of results in light of (1) findings from previous studies of cash
transfers and integrated sanitation and nutrition interventions, and (2)
the context of concurrent CCTs and health services targeting early
childhood.

# Written report

Weaver et al. (2024) [@neq32ak0ch2] evaluate the impacts of an
unconditional cash transfer program in the state of Jharkand, India on
four main outcome domains: household expenditure, household food
consumption, child anthropometrics, and child development. The cash
transfer, valued at \$170 USD in total (or \$7 USD per month), was
delivered to approximately 2,400 mothers over two years starting at
their child's birth, and accompanied by messaging to use the money for
nutritious food for themselves and their child. Data was collected at 11
months of transfers (Y1), 23 months of transfers (Y2), and 1-1.5 years
after the last transfers (Y3).

-   For household expenditures, treatment is associated with an increase
    in food expenditure of about 41% of the value of the transfer.

-   For food consumption, they estimate an increase in calorie intake of
    18% (Y1) to 14% (Y2) for the target child and 8.5% (Y1) to 16% (Y2)
    for mothers.

-   For anthropometrics, they observe no impacts on the HAZ, WAZ,
    probability of stunting, or probability of being underweight for the
    target child, but curiously observe improvements in WAZ for older
    siblings of the target child of .11-.13 SD.

-   For child development, the authors find moderate impacts of .12 SD
    on overall ASQ-3 scores, and .09-.10 SD on the cognitive, gross
    motor, and fine motor subscales individually.

They additionally find small improvements in maternal nutritional
knowledge (Y1 and Y2), maternal empowerment (Y1 only), use of selected
child health services (Y1 only), and probability of visiting a formal
medical provider (Y1 and Y2).

The most important contribution of this paper is that it is the first
study of the impacts of unconditional cash transfers in India. It
features a large sample size relative to other studies of cash transfers
and ECD, as well as a comprehensive set of outcomes for household
consumption and maternal and child health. The analysis is thorough (as
per their pre-analysis plan) and well-written

## Major Comments

-   **Coherence and framing**

    -   It is striking to me that there are substantial gains in child
        development even in the absence of impacts on anthropometrics
        *or* any parenting/other behavioral "plus" components. Previous
        cash transfer studies that measured ECD outcomes and
        anthropometrics together had mixed results--typically impacts on
        neither (Ecuador: Paxson 2010 [@nstz1zsud7i], Niger: Premand
        2020 [@nq01mgfciwx], Nepal: Levere 2024 [@n34niwt6ruf]) or both
        (Mexico: Fernald 2008 [@nwwj59an8sq], Nicaragua: Macours 2012
        [@n2zysnc8epv], Tanzania: Sudfeld 2021 [@nc34w1inclc]), but on
        occasion only on *anthropometrics* (Nigeria: Carneiro 2021
        [@na2nmg7u5wz]). Why do you think your results diverge from
        previous studies?\

    -   The Nepal study (Levere 2024 [@nvh6mbs96lu]) also observed
        impacts on anthropometrics for older siblings only. Are there
        any commonalities between your study and the Nepal study that
        could explain the replication of this finding?\

    -   To follow from the introduction and motivation, I suggest a
        longer discussion of the individual maternal empowerment items
        and the bank account usage indicators in Table A.1 (i.e.,
        evidence on the empowerment → maternal and child consumption and
        health expenditure → child development pathway). I would then
        return to the hypothesis of the "triple dividends" in the
        conclusion section. What are the policy implications for
        maternal empowerment and gender equity? Is there any case for
        policymakers to adopt UCTs over other types of interventions
        that can enhance intra-household gender equity, in terms of
        consumption or decision-making power for mothers (e.g.
        education, job training, behavioral)?\

    -   In the same vein, I suggest dropping or moving to footnotes the
        paragraphs on (1) benchmarking against the marginal propensity
        to consume from in-kind transfers, (2) estimating the income
        elasticity of food expenditure or calorie consumption, (3)
        explaining the "puzzle" of falling calorie consumption, etc.
        since they do not address the question of whether and to what
        extent cash transfers improve maternal and child well-being
        specifically (not just recipients in general).\

-   UCT in the context of other CCTs

    -   The program in question was implemented alongside existing
        conditional cash transfer programs JSY (conditional on
        institutional delivery) and PMMV-Y (conditional on receiving
        antenatal care and vaccinations). Footnotes 8 and 30 state that
        the UCT did not affect eligibility for the CCTs, and that the
        value of the CCTs was too small relative to the value of the
        UCTs to affect interpretation of results. Although the value of
        these CCTs was indeed smaller than the value of the UCT, and
        overall take-up rates of the CCTs are relatively low (12% in the
        control group and an additional 4% in the treatment group
        according to Table A.10), the fact that a subset of the UCT
        participants were simultaneously meeting conditionalities that
        could affect anthropometrics and ECD outcomes seems worth
        discussing. What impact do the authors think the JSY and PMMV-Y
        conditionalities may have had on the effectiveness of the UCT?\

    -   Furthermore, it is notable that the program in question was
        situated within a broader system that was already delivering
        cash transfers and health, nutrition, and ECD services at scale
        (i.e., a system with an ECD agenda, significant health
        infrastructure, and high engagement with child health services,
        including nutrition, as the authors note). How does this compare
        to the context in other countries that have implemented UCTs
        targeting early childhood: Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ecuador,
        Madagascar, Nepal, Niger, Uganda? Is this a "high baseline"?\

-   **The role of sanitation**

    -   The authors argue that sanitation is the primary reason that
        increased calorie intake/nutrition did not result in impacts on
        growth outcomes for the target child. However, other studies in
        LMICs have compared joint nutrition and sanitation interventions
        to only nutrition interventions directly, and effects on
        stunting, wasting, and underweight are not consistently better
        (see below for references). Please comment.\

    -   The authors reconcile the heterogeneity of impacts on the target
        child by sanitation with the lack of corresponding heterogeneity
        in impacts on older siblings by "age-based differences in
        vulnerability to poor sanitation", i.e. younger children are
        more susceptible (less immune) to diarrheal disease. Could other
        factors that are correlated with sanitation and birth order
        (e.g. changes in dietary composition or food preparation
        practices, especially when weaning) be responsible for this
        pattern?\

-   **Exclusion of breastmilk from child food consumption**

    -   It is not clear to me why the calorie intake and dietary
        diversity measurements do not include breastmilk as a
        category--especially at Y1, when 96% of mothers were still
        breastfeeding, but also at Y2, given that WHO guidelines
        recommend breastfeeding with complementary food feeding until at
        least age 2. If the cash increased maternal caloric intake, it
        could also have increased the number of feeds or the nutritional
        content of breastmilk, leading to even larger impacts on child
        caloric intake and dietary diversity. In other words, without
        including breastmilk, the estimates in Table 2 would represent
        lower bounds.\

-   **Things that are missing**

    -   Discussion of how measures were selected and if they were
        adapted or validated for the study population, especially the
        ASQ

    -   Discussion of why certain outcomes only showed up in Y1 or Y2,
        or changed in magnitude from Y1 to Y2

-   **Tables**

    -   Table 1

        -   The IHS transformed expenditures are difficult to interpret.
            Can you provide some intuition for how large the 15-IHS
            point and 21 IHS-point increases are either in terms of
            Rs./USD or percentages of the monthly or total transfers
            (i.e. an elasticity)?\

        -   Table note should be clearer about the units for each
            outcome. Are columns (2), (6), and (9) probabilities;
            columns (3), (7), and (10) natural logs; and column (4) raw
            spending in Rs.?\

        -   I would concentrate on food spending, and drop the "sin
            spending" and "non-food spending" columns which have fewer
            observations and are less interesting\

    -   Table 2

        -   Clarify who is included in the "household" column (column
            (3))\--are child and mother excluded? Are the remaining
            members averaged?\

        -   If I'm reading the nutrient index column correctly (column
            (8)), the control means are extremely low and the treatment
            effect sizes are massive. On average control mothers are
            only consuming 19% of the recommended daily value of
            nutrients in Y1 and 22% in Y2, and the treatment effects are
            9% and 17%, respectively. Moreover, the text on page 13
            mentions an effect size of .33 SD in Y2, which I do not see
            here.\

        -   Abstract states impacts of 9.6%-15.5%, which are also not
            seen here. Kindly check.\

    -   Table 3

        -   Consider standardizing all the outcomes that are indices, so
            that their treatment effects are in terms of SD\

    -   Table 4

        -   Label columns "ASQ score" throughout instead of "child
            development index"\

    -   Table 5

        -   Suggest reversing the order of Panel A and Panel B, since if
            I understand correctly, Panel A is derived from Panel B\
