# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Existential Risk and
Growth\" [@nlovklt8wyd]. The evaluators see the paper as a substantively
important model informing a critical question, but have concerns about
the degree to which the assumptions and model structure are sufficient
for actually answering key questions. To read these evaluations, please
see the links below.

## **Evaluations**

1\. [Seth G.
Benzell](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e1existentialrisk "null")

2\. [Ioannis
Bournakis](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e2existentialrisk "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^1]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed

*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summaries

## Seth G. Benzell {#seth-g-benzell}

Authors find: (1) existential risk follows an inverted-u shape in both
technology level and over time (2), technological accelerations reduce
cumulative existential danger. These findings are novel and important,
implying a "time of perils" after which safety is (asymptotically)
assured. Two critiques: (1) the representative agent of the model is
neither a normative goal nor a positive prediction, making implications
nebulous (2) omission of savings from the model eliminates a potential
mechanism for intertemporal consumption smoothing, which may impact
demand for safety.

## Ioannis Bournakis

The paper examines how hazard rates change with varying speeds of
technological advancement, questioning the wisdom of slowing progress.
It finds a trade-off between technological progress and safety as
countries prosper under optimal policies, illustrating a Kuznets curve
where hazard rates decrease post-technological advancement. Despite its
critical inquiry into whether technology jeopardizes society, it
overlooks integrating a benefit function with hazard assessment. This
omission limits the ability to assess technology\'s overall impact. With
adjustments, it merits publication in a 3-star journal, likely achieving
acceptance after revisions.

# Evaluation manager's discussion (David Manheim) 

The evaluators see the paper as a substantively important model
informing a critical question, but have concerns about the degree to
which the assumptions and model structure are sufficient for actually
answering key questions. This is in large part a drawback of this class
of approach, rather than the paper itself, and it seems useful as a base
for further research on the questions of how to consider the "time of
perils" hypothesis.\
\
As the evaluations note, their criticisms do not imply that the paper
itself is not good or useful; the same applies to the below comments on
the generally excellent and helpful evaluations.\
\
Regarding the first evaluation, I think the question of savings is
potentially important, and could potentially be addressed, at least at a
high level. On the other hand, the questions about whether the model
describes the actual dynamics of decision-making in a race scenario are
certainly valid, but the paper is still useful. For example, the model
in the paper is helpful in describing what policymakers who respect
social preference should be aiming for as an optimal outcome, which can
inform what we should normatively aim for. As a secondary point, it
seems unhelpful to posit that if society had very different social
preferences, the result would not apply - this paper is a case where the
assumptions generally match reality, so they are helpfully simplifying.\
\
Regarding the second evaluation, balancing risk and reward is certainly
critical, but it seems unclear how this would affect the results, given
the almost axiomatic assumptions that AI would be beneficial if not
harmful. The other criticisms seem correct, but not substantively
useful, considering that the paper is not attempting to provide a way to
gather empirical evidence, or address the understood shortcoming of
using exogenous growth.

## Why we chose this pape*r *

*From our prioritization notes:* This paper addresses a very important
current policy discussion related to how to respond to technological
advances when they pose large-scale risks with a simple conceptual
model. It seems like a possible critical crux between different
approaches to technological advances, e.g. progress
studies/accelerationism versus safety, risk mitigation, and much of
actual tech policy. Given that the arguments are somewhat technical, and
the usefulness of the conceptual approach is unclear, it seems likely to
benefit from rigorous review of the technical arguments and assumptions,
and thought about whether and how the model should inform policy
considerations.

## Evaluation process

The authors engaged strongly with this process. Phil Trammell kept us
informed about the updates the authors were making, and let us know as
soon as these were released. We appreciate the authors' engagement with
our process, including their substantive response to the evaluators'
comments.

    to learn how this changed, and to see the earlier instructions.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: The paper addresses the critical topic of how technological
    development intersects with existential risks, highlighting the need
    for nuanced definitions and specific contextual applications.

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: Wide uncertainty on this. If we were to ever design a global AI
    safety hegemon, who wants to balance between the path of consumption
    per-capita and safety, this style of work would be particularly
    important. In a \"Race\" scenario these results are irrelevant. In a
    scenario where social preference bends either 100% towards safety,
    towards more-people-same-per-capita-income type-growth, or just
    become more risk tolerant, the rhetorical relevance of this
    balancing social planner would be low.

[^8]: To understand the role of technology one needs to consider that
    risks coexist with benefits. This approach does not exist in the
    present approach, I found this the biggest shortcoming.

[^9]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^10]: I am mostly concerned about the high-risk aversion selected as
    focal, as well as robustness to allowing for saving. There is also
    the general background concern that AI safety research might be
    completely ineffective.

[^11]: This paper provides a theoretical framework that is rigorous,
    coherent, and well-executed.

[^12]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^13]: The assumption of an exogenous technology is simple and
    convenient but not always realistic.

[^14]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^15]: I remain skeptical about the feasibility of testing empirically
    the proposition of the present analysis.

[^16]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^17]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^18]: A significant limitation of the analysis is its high level of
    aggregation, which often hinders the identification of specific
    implications for different sectors.
