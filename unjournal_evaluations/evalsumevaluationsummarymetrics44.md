# Abstract 

We organized \[N\] evaluations of the paper \[Paper title with link\].
\[Comments on the evaluations and ratings here ... 'both evaluators rate
the paper highly' etc.\] This paper was evaluated as part of our
"applied and policy stream", described
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2 "null"),
and evaluators were asked to use use the applied evaluation form
[here](https://coda.io/form/Unjournal-evaluation-form-applied-stream_dkjUPyzvHoH "null").
To read these evaluations, please see the links below. \[*Mention* *COI
considerations if any\]*

***\[Below, we offer a template for hosting Unjournal applied stream
evaluation summaries in PubPub, version 6, to be linked to the actual
evaluations. ****This template can also be used for sharing with authors
(as a draft), for their response, before the full package is
released.\]*

*\[This template is for our applied and policy stream; it is slightly
different for our main academic stream\]*

evaluation](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/jgms1oox/release/1 "null")

2\. Name \[or 'anonymous\] here, with hyperlink to the evaluation

## Overall ratings

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

### Note: Applied and Policy Stream

This paper was evaluated as part of our "applied and policy stream",
described
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2 "null").
The ratings should not be directly compared to those in our main
academic stream.

**Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically"
as a percentile "relative to applied and policy research you have read
aiming at a similar audience, and with similar goals." We requested they
"consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to future
impactful applied research, and practical relevance and usefulness."

# Evaluation manager's discussion (optional)

Evaluation managers: After the evaluations and author responses are in,
you may want to give a brief synthesis and reflection on the research,
the evaluations, and the response, considering the implications of
these, future directions, etc. You can insert your own judgment here, if
you like.

# Unjournal process notes (\~optional)  

Evaluation managers: We usually put a brief discussion of why we
prioritized this work and the evaluation process here. Please try to
keep this concise: avoid boilerplate, profuse gratitude or flattery.
There is no need to report on the parts of this process that worked
normally.

***Note on versions:**** \[if evaluators considered different versions
of the paper\]*

## Why we chose this paper \[these headings are optional\]

You may want to integrate comments here from the "manager's notes" (aka
'bespoke evaluation notes') previously shared with the evaluators

## How we chose the evaluators

## Evaluation process

[^1]: Create a new 'pub', copy in the material below, filling in as
    necessary, and checking/adjusting to maintain the desired
    formatting. 'Pub settings' will need adjusting. Pub settings will
    also need to be configured. See our internal Coda documentation.\
    Update 10 Jun 2024  --- we now have an API call code to create the
    shell for a connected 'evaluation package'. We're working on an LLM
    based bots or a code tool to fill in the content, especially the
    tables.

[^2]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^3]: And delete the text stating 'fill in actual numbers.' Note as of 9
    Jun 2024 we are working on a simple \~chatgpt bot to automate the
    production of all tables through cutting and pasting content into a
    chat window.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to future impactful
    applied research, and practical relevance and usefulness.

[^5]: I am not sure what to compare this to, because I am unclear about
    scope. So please don't take these ratings seriously.

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to improving the rigor
    and reliability of applied research and evidence-based policymaking
    in this area? Focus on 'improvements that are actually helpful' for
    global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: Pro: It talks about important concepts that may not be known to
    decision makers\

    Con: I think it needs more work (to have workable guidelines) before
    it can actually impact practice. It would be good if this report
    could be related to existing literature on grading evidence etc.

    \

[^8]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^9]: I think this is a report summarising some methodological
    literature, so I won't assess on this metric

[^10]: When applying the procedure, the conclusion seems very vulnerable
    to small chances in assumptions about how specific factors (e.g.,
    social desirability) influence effect sizes. Further, there are no
    guidelines provided for how to determine the impact of these
    specific factors.

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: Pro: right level of detail for decision makers, good use of plain
    language to communicate the concepts.

    Con: A lot of repetition, needs more clarity in some places. Figures
    and tables need reworking to be useful.

    \

[^13]: At several points a more detailed explanation is required.

[^14]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^15]: I think the main "replicable" part of this paper are guidelines,
    and as I indicated, I think these need to be revised to apply to
    particular cases. I don't think an average reader would be able to
    use them right off the bat.

[^16]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

    Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners. Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?

[^17]: I think this is very relevant to global priorities research!
    Question marks over focus

[^18]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^19]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^20]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.
