# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Biodiversity
Risk"[@n6q6a36mvzi]. To read these evaluations, please see the links
below.

## **Evaluations**

1\. [Anonymous evaluation

2\. [Anonymous evaluation
2](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e2biodiversityrisk/ "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^1]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").)
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluation 1

The paper evaluates whether biodiversity risk is priced in asset markets
and breaks new ground in doing so. It concludes that biodiversity risk
is priced and provides open-source metrics for measuring biodiversity
risk based on media reporting and firm-level biodiversity risk exposure
based on 10K reports. The paper\'s strength is that it uses primary data
that is well-documented and offers it for further research. One
important weakness is that both the statistical and economic
significance of the result are not sufficiently discussed.

## Anonymous evaluation 2[^4]

This paper seeks to measure biodiversity risk. It does so in several
ways:

-   Via a news based measure 

-   textual analysis of corporate disclosures 

-   a survey of finance professionals, regulators and academics 

The authors then apply their measures in an asset pricing and portfolio
context and find that markets are pricing biodiversity risk to some
degree but their survey respondents believe that market pricing of
biodiversity risk is incomplete.

# Evaluation manager's discussion

"Biodiversity Risk" clearly adds to our understanding of the impact of
Environment Social and Governance concerns on financial returns, with a
focus on the emerging area of risks owing to changes in biodiversity.
Moreover, it offers a novel measure of perceived biodiversity risk which
can be used by future studies, perhaps in some form of shift-share
(/Bartik) instrument approach.

While this paper offers novel insight, there are a few areas in which it
could be improved, or more explicitly recognise its shortcomings. As
both evaluations highlight, it is somewhat ambiguous as to what the
paper is identifying as biodiversity risk. First, both evaluations
highlight that the measure of biodiversity risk is perceptions, rather
than on-the-ground changes in biodiversity risk. Indeed, large changes
in actual biodiversity risk - at least physical risk - in such
timeframes seem somewhat unlikely. Second, both evaluations (and
particularly the second) mention the concern that measured biodiversity
risk may well be picking up climate risk, and that this could be more
comprehensively explored in the paper. Third, evaluation 2 highlights
that nuance could be added to the discussion by disentangling physical
and transition risks.

Personally, I wonder to what extent the lack of nuance in defining
biodiversity risk per se within the paper is in part limited by the
dictionary approach that is currently being used, which I think could
well result in overly broad definitions of what constitutes biodiversity
risk. If this overly broad classification is orthogonal to other
factors, then the noise introduced would "only" result in estimates
biased towards zero. However, there may be confounding effects
introduced if those biodiversity-related terms are being used in
different contexts at systematically different rates (i.e.
disproportionately by a particular subset of firms or sectors).

Finally, both evaluations suggest to me that the policy implications of
this research could be better explored. For instance, what does this
research suggest would be required within the financial sector in order
to see better pricing of biodiversity risks? Is that even possible
within financial sector regulation, or is regulation on the actual firms
and their damages required? Indeed, it seems that more could be
discussed within the paper about the externality regarding which
firms/sectors are *exposed *to biodiversity risk, versus which are
responsible for *damages *to biodiversity and increasing biodiversity
risks. Similarly more could be said about the different timeframes over
which damages to, and the negative impacts of, biodiversity risk are
likely to occur, and the potential implications of this.

## How we chose the evaluators

We looked for evaluators with:

1.  Expertise in text analysis.

2.  Expertise in measuring company performance indicators.

    to learn how this changed, and to see the earlier instructions.

[^4]: A previous release accidentally noted Ben Balmford as the
    evaluator in some of the statistics tables. Ben was an evaluation
    manager for this paper; he was not an evaluator.

[^5]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^8]: The authors did a good job of providing several analyses. Also, it
    is appreciated that the authors adjust for multiple testing.
    However, the lack of reporting of confidence intervals and standard
    errors weakens the robustness of the results.

[^9]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^10]: The paper presents a good analysis of the perception of
    biodiversity risk in equity markets. However, the methodology
    introduced in the paper is not always easy to follow for readers
    unfamiliar with the topic, as it omits a short, simple explanation
    at the beginning and covers several aspects simultaneously.

[^11]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^12]: The authors should be commended for providing the exposure
    measures and news index on their website. However, the authors fail
    to mention how the sample of firms was created, and do not provide
    sample statistics. Such an omission makes replication nearly
    impossible.

[^13]: excellent - replicability should be high

[^14]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^15]: On one hand, practitioners can benefit from using the firm-level
    exposure measures. The authors also explain how certain industries
    are exposed to biodiversity risk. On the other hand, policy makers
    have little to gain from the paper, as the question of whether the
    risk pricing is adequate is not addressed.

[^16]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^17]: The paper addresses a topic that is of global relevance.

[^18]: Should make it in a marginal A or B journal.

[^19]: Authors are prominent in prominent institutions.
