# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper \"Forecasts estimate limited
cultured meat production through 2050\" [@nuuwgy15gsh], a Rethink
Priorities project, also posted on the EA Forum
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2b9HCjTiFnWM8jkRM/forecasts-estimate-limited-cultured-meat-production-through "null").
This was evaluated as part of our "applied and policy stream", described
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2 "null").
We also asked evaluators to consider this in connection with our Pivotal
Question on the viability of cultured meat (see forum discussion
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7ha23d3qzXiCqYLDq/the-viability-of-cultured-meat-unjournal-s-first-pivotal "null")),
and to provide feedback that would help us consider and operationalize
this question (see public work [here](b "null")). The evaluators were
fairly positive about the potential for cultured meat and see some of
the choices D&Z made as overly pessimistic, with at least one \~typo in
the information provided to the evaluators leaning towards pessimism.
They also point to a range of newer TEAs and results. Manheim also
argues that even expensive "luxury" cultured meat provides a path
forward. To read these evaluations, please see the links below.

## Overall ratings

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *However, for this particular case
we de-emphasized the ratings aspect. We asked evaluators to focus on (1)
whether the claims made in the paper were valid and up-to-date and (2)
things that the authors could have done better, particularly considering
ways to better plan and structure future synthesis and forecasting
exercises better.

# Evaluation summaries

## David Manheim

The review finds Rethink Priorities' 2022 cultured meat forecast
methodologically sound but limited and misleading. It critiques the
pessimistic framing, exclusion of luxury-product adoption, and potential
premature impact on funding. Despite uncertainty on mass scale by 2050,
falling input costs and emerging luxury markets suggest greater promise
than implied. Still, success depends on scaling, adoption, and
investment.

## Estere Seinkmane

My evaluation focused on assessing the assumptions and providing
up-to-date context and background for the forecasting paper. The paper
(post) was published in 2022, and relied on 2020-2021 data. Since then,
at least eight cultivated meat (CM) products have been approved, claimed
costs are below \$20/kg, CM researchers exceed 250, and total funding
surpassed \$3B, coming from VC, public research funding, and
philanthropic organisations. The CM definition (cell types, species, %
in hybrid products), the media cost components, and other relevant
technologies could be clarified, esp. in the context of more novel
findings, to improve further CM forecasts.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

### Why we prioritized this research

Our impression: this work, along with the [author\'s previous
post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8jHKDkhPXApHp2gb/cultured-meat-a-comparison-of-techno-economic-analyses "null")
(a comparison of TEAs) may have been somewhat influential in reducing
support and funding for the development of cultured meat, particularly
in the effective altruism community. E.g., Faunalytics [did a research
summary](https://faunalytics.org/will-cultured-meat-be-widely-available-by-2050/ "null")
on this. David Humbird's 2020 [techno-economic
analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348009195_Scale-Up_Economics_for_Cultured_Meat_Techno-Economic_Analysis_and_Due_Diligence "null")
(TEA), which this work cites heavily, seems have been even more
influential. While this work is now somewhat old, it did not seem to
have been superceded by a different \~narrative on the EA forum. It also
outlined key cruxes, models, and research in a way that was particularly
helpful for framing our cultured meat Pivotal Question.

## Evaluation process

### Overview, guidelines, steps

We asked these evaluators to consider 

-   the relevance and currency of that work,

-   the (updated) implications for the potential for cultured meat
    (informing our PQ) and

-   the approaches D&Z took, and how future work should follow their
    example or make different choices

The evaluators are fairly positive about the potential for cultured meat
and see some of the choices D&Z made as overly pessimistic, with at
least one \~typo in the information provided to the evaluators leaning
towards pessimism. They also point to a range of newer TEAs and results.
And Manheim makes a case that even expensive \"luxury\" CM provide a
path forward.

Following this, we\'ll ask different sets of evaluators to consider the
body of TEAs and related recent research, and to provide structured
evaluations of a small set of these, as well as stating their beliefs
about a set of operationalized PQs sub-questions.  And this will feed
into our [Metaculus forecasting
community](https://www.metaculus.com/c/unjournal/ "null") and our
overall synthesis.

See [here
](https://coda.io/d/Unjournal-Public-Pages_ddIEzDONWdb/PQs-Finalized-operationalizations-Metaculus_sul3xyZw#_luOhia3N "null")for
our database of PQs, operationalization work, and PQ research being
prioritized.

### Choice of evaluators

*** ***We chose evaluators to balance forecasting, economics, and
quantification expertise (Manheim) with expertise in biology and this
specific technological context (Seinkmane), as well as some links
outside the Effective Altruism/effective animal welfare ecosystem.
Neither reported a conflict of interest, nor an inherent stake in
promoting cultivated meat (see Seinkmane's disclaimer in the appendix to
her report). Both evaluators also provided us feedback on this pivotal
questions project and the question operationalization.

### COI issues

David Reinstein acted as the co-evaluation manager for this paper,
(along with Ashley Meader). Reinstein suggested this paper particularly
to inform our Pivotal Question on the viability of cultured meat (see
forum discussion
[here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7ha23d3qzXiCqYLDq/the-viability-of-cultured-meat-unjournal-s-first-pivotal "null")).
David Reinstein worked at Rethink Priorities alongside the authors
(although in a different team) from 2021-2023. The first evaluator,
David Manheim, is also a Field Specialist at The Unjournal, and voted in
favor of prioritizing this research (as did David Reinstein and four
other team members).

### Author engagement

*** ***The authors were aware of this evaluation and shared some helpful
thoughts early in the process. They also clarified some details in
response to David Manheim (the first evaluator) about a mistake in the
information provided to their forecasters. We gave them the opportunity
to respond to this, and also reached out to William McAuliffe, a Senior
Research Manager at Rethink Priorities. They each declined to respond.
(As always, if they respond in future, we will integrate it here.)

[^1]: This paper was evaluated as part of our "applied and policy
    stream", described
    [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2).
    The ratings should not be directly compared to those in our main
    academic stream.

[^2]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to applied and policy research you have read aiming at a
    similar audience, and with similar goals." We requested they
    "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to future
    impactful applied research, and practical relevance and usefulness."

[^3]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to future impactful
    applied research, and practical relevance and usefulness.

[^5]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\
    \
    This was on the newer form only

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^8]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^9]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^10]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^11]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^12]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^13]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^14]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^15]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^16]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.
