# Abstract [^1]

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Social Safety Nets, Women's
Economic Achievements and Agency\"[@nnfrhps24mp] ([January 2025 version
linked
here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1mtqkljv0qwnzp2314p0d/Manuscript_SSN-Women-s-Agency_17Jan2025.pdf?rlkey=3fq2z4vn2kl1q95hsrq6hkrfo&st=q4cm10ql&dl=0 "null"))
which was conditionally accepted at Nature Human Behavior as of April
2025. This meta-analysis examines how social safety nets impact women's
economic and empowerment/agency outcomes across 45 LMICs. They broadly
find positive impacts on both economic and psychometric outcomes in this
domain.[^2]  The evaluations mix praise ("rigorous systematic review
methodology; sound meta-analysis methods" ... "very timely") and
substantive criticism. The intermediate ratings suggest the paper is
approximately at the level of work published in a top or marginal
'B-journal'. Both evaluators provide concrete recommendations to improve
this paper to make it more credible and useful to policymakers. Masset
argues that "average effect sizes shown are not very informative in
relation to the policy goal of selecting \[the\] most effective
intervention or the research goal of designing better interventions." He
calls for theoretical justification for pooling heterogeneous
interventions, separate effect size summaries by intervention type and
outcome, and additional explanatory factors in the meta-regression.
Sabates-Wheeler requests more practical policy recommendations, as well
as greater detail on programme design and context. She notes that "the
cost-benefit analysis is limited due to a lack of comprehensive data";
this might be addressed in future work. To read these evaluations,

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^3])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^4]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Edoardo Masset

The main strengths of the paper are the use of a rigorous systematic
review methodology; the use of sound meta-analysis methods; and the
focus on women-level outcomes and on the goal of reducing gender
disparities. The results summarise the impact of highly heterogeneous
intervention on highly heterogeneous outcomes. The average effect sizes
shown are not very informative in relation to the policy goal of
selecting most effective intervention or the research goal of designing
better interventions. I recommend a) to provide a theoretical
justification for pooling highly heterogeneous interventions b) to
summarize effect sizes separately by intervention type and outcomes; c)
to include further explanatory factors in the meta-regression.

## Rachel Sabates-Wheeler

The paper helpfully reviews the impact of social safety nets (SSNs) on
gender inequality. It highlights that SSNs can enhance women\'s economic
achievements and agency, particularly through increased labour force
participation and decision-making power. However, the effects on care
work intensity are not significant. The cost-benefit analysis is limited
due to a lack of comprehensive data. The paper is an excellent resource,
but needs some improvements on policy suggestions.

# **Evaluation manager's discussion**

*This discussion was written by Sarah A. Reynolds*[^20]

## Why we chose this study:

This study unites the themes of poverty alleviation and women's
empowerment by examining a variety of social safety nets (cash, in-kind,
and asset transfers) and their impact on a variety of different types of
women's agency outcomes (both economic and psychometric) in 45 low- and
middle-income countries.  This meta-analysis finds most types of social
safety nets increase both female economic achievements and voice. 
Additionally, the effort of providing a quantified comparison of the
impacts along with the theoretical and contextual discussion of why they
differ is extremely helpful for interpretation and determining the
practicality of implementation for improving the situation of women. 
This summary of previous research will help to establish a standard for
future research to include cost-benefit analysis on areas that have been
difficult to measure such as women's agency but are clearly important
for individual, household, and community well-being (economic and
otherwise).

## Summary of the evaluations:

[Edoardo Masset's evaluation
](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e1safetynets/draft?access=s22pj9zo "null")
provides an excellent analysis of how the paper fits into the current
literature and suggestions for directions forward that could improve
upon the measurement and comparison of the findings.  For example, a
separation of the *women's agency* outcomes and the *economic* outcomes
may reflect different expected outcome magnitudes in different realms;
economic outcomes often have meaningful numeric interpretation that may
be lost when standardizing to compare to agency outcomes.

[Rachel Sabates-Wheeler's
evaluation](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e2safetynets/draft?access=ze4gzccm "null")
focuses on the current policy landscape, emphasizing measurable economic
impacts: "The evidence here suggests that SSNs can be seen as an
investment given the significant outcomes on economic achievement --
especially labour force participation and productive work intensity.
Furthermore, the results show that SSN have strong and positive impacts
on voice, autonomy and decision-making."  Areas that would be most
valuable for future research to further support this conclusion are
cost-benefit analysis and a longer-scale to follow-up for agency
outcomes.

### Paper status, research direction

The version of the paper we evaluated was from January 2025 [(linked
here)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1mtqkljv0qwnzp2314p0d/Manuscript_SSN-Women-s-Agency_17Jan2025.pdf?rlkey=3fq2z4vn2kl1q95hsrq6hkrfo&st=q4cm10ql&dl=0 "null"),
conditionally accepted at Nature Human Behavior as of April 2025.  The
work is likely to be published without significant revision at this
stage. We expect these evaluations to provide valuable scientific
dialogue for moving the research forward and we believe they indicate
key areas for future studies to build on this work that will likely
become seminal in the field.

[^17]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^18]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^19]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.
