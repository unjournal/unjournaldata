# Abstract 

The paper evaluates whether biodiversity risk is priced in asset markets
and breaks new ground in doing so. It concludes that biodiversity risk
is priced and provides open-source metrics for measuring biodiversity
risk based on media reporting and firm-level biodiversity risk exposure
based on 10K reports. The paper\'s strength is that it uses primary data
that is well-documented and offers it for further research. One
important weakness is that both the statistical and economic
significance of the result are not sufficiently discussed.

# Written report

## Summary 

The paper analyses how biodiversity risk is reflected in the stock
market. It contributes to the early literature on the relationship
between finance and biodiversity (Garel et al. 2023[@nag8zi8huy7];
Flammer, Giroux, and Heal 2023)[@n1ttsz6w45n]. It finds that
biodiversity risk is priced and provides open-source metrics for
measuring biodiversity risk based on media reporting and firm-level
biodiversity risk exposure based on 10K reports. In doing so, the paper
addresses a new and important topic and facilitates further research on
biodiversity risk in financial markets.

Following a methodology developed by some of the same authors in the
context of climate finance (Engle et al. 2020)[@nbgqw33yjvy], the paper
constructs a \"biodiversity risk news index\" that provides a time
series of news about the level of biodiversity risk. The authors also
develop several metrics of firm-level exposure to biodiversity risk by
parsing 10-K reports. In addition, they collect survey responses from
664 academics, practitioners, and regulators to understand perceptions
of biodiversity risk. Using these inputs, the authors construct a
mimicking portfolio and document a positive correlation between changes
in the tone of biodiversity news and the portfolio\'s returns. The
authors benchmark their biodiversity risk hedging portfolio against
other factors. The paper concludes that biodiversity risk is priced into
equity markets, but market participants do not consider the pricing
appropriate. An additional analysis of municipal bond portfolios
concludes that the same risk is not priced in bond returns.

## Evaluation 

The paper's main claim is that biodiversity risk is priced in equity
markets. Specifically, the paper claims that news about biodiversity
risk are correlated with returns of a portfolio sorted on biodiversity
risk exposure.

The authors provide reasonable evidence for this claim. This is shown by
constructing mimicking portfolios that are long (short) in industries
with low (high) past exposure to biodiversity risk, according to an
industry aggregation of the firm-level exposure measures created by the
authors. Using this approach and a mimicking portfolio approach (which
determines weights by regressing the series of innovations in the
biodiversity news index on the series of firm-level excess returns), the
authors find apositive correlation of 10% to 20% between the portfolio
returns and innovations in the news about biodiversity risk, using nine
different variations of constructing the portfolios.

The authors do a good job of dismissing the concern that the measures of
biodiversity risk capture other known firm characteristics by repeating
the mimicking portfolio exercise with 207 characteristics (Chen and
Zimmermann 2022)[@n0d0n4elv9t].

The authors are aware that they are testing a joint hypothesis, stating:
"If biodiversity risk is priced in asset markets---and if our measures
of exposure to this risk are correct---we would expect the price of
these portfolios to move with the arrival of (aggregate) news about
biodiversity risks." Upon finding evidence of such comovement, the
authors conclude that their measures are correct and that the risk is
priced.

Two points limit the paper's central claim. First, it is not clear
whether the observed correlation is sufficient to accept the hypothesis.
Second, the paper assumes that *news* about biodiversity risk reflects
the true biodiversity risk.

Regarding correlation, the paper is not clear on whether a correlation
of 10% to 20% is enough to conclude with confidence that biodiversity
risks are priced. The confidence interval of these point estimates is
not provided (see Figures 9 and 10, for example). There is also no
discussion of the estimate\'s economic significance. Appendix A.4.3
reveals a p-value of one of the nine estimates (0.0462), but this
information should be prominently disclosed in the main body of the
paper.

The paper employs several measures, but the leading measure is based on
news in the New York Times. It is not unreasonable to assume that the
media reflects biodiversity risks. However, it is a critical assumption
that is made, and the paper does not provide a sufficient discussion of
this concern. The underlying biodiversity risk is potentially very large
and slow-moving, as the paper points out in the introduction. It is
conceivable that media-based indices capture changing levels of
attention while the underlying risk remains unchanged. It is also the
case that biodiversity risks can play out at very local scales, which
means that a month-to-month change in national news coverage can be
completely unrelated to dramatic local events, or that the news arrives
when the risks on the ground have already materialized. It is important
to be clear that the paper technically studies whether *news* about
biodiversity risk is priced.

Further limitations that apply to the potential replication of the
results is that the authors do not provide instructions on how the
sample of firms is collected (Appendix A.4.5 describes how the sample of
municipal bonds was collected, however). Furthermore, the paper does not
report any of the results from the regression used to determine the
mimicking portfolio weights (on page 30), which is an important step of
the methodology.

## Advancing Knowledge 

The main academic contributions of the paper are to (1) introduce new
firm-level measures of biodiversity risk exposure and an index of
biodiversity-related news, and (2) show that biodiversity risk is priced
in equity markets. The authors provide evidence that their new measures
of biodiversity risk are not simply capturing previous measures of
climate risk in equity markets. While the results suggest that some risk
is being priced in equity markets (but not in municipal bond markets),
the authors explicitly leave the question of whether the risk is
adequately priced to future research.

The authors acknowledge that they do not differentiate between cash flow
effects and investor preferences. When a New York Times article
highlights deforestation, investor interest in deforestation is likely
to rise, and investor favor for companies that engage in deforestation
may decrease. This could lead to a decline in stock prices for these
companies, resulting in lower returns in the short term, even if there
are no changes in cash flow forecasts. In the current set-up, there is
no way to differentiate between the shift of investor preferences or a
change in future cash flows, which results in lower returns.

## Real World Relevance 

There are two reasons why this paper has real-world relevance. First,
the authors provide the exposure measures and news index on their
website (https://www.biodiversityrisk.org/). Investors are free to use
this data to identify firms that use biodiversity-related words in their
10-K disclosures, for example. Second, the authors spend several pages
(in section 2.3) explaining which specific risks the industries with the
highest biodiversity risk are exposed to. Arguments are supplemented by
snippets from firms' 10-K disclosures. This analysis could be useful for
practitioners who are trying to understand how biodiversity affects the
business operations of certain industries.

The question of whether biodiversity risk is adequately priced is most
relevant to the real world. The paper provides an indicative answer
based on surveys, suggesting that the risk is not adequately priced.
This is an initial step, but it is not yet a reliable answer because it
is survey-based. Respondents may wish that biodiversity risks would be
priced more because then market forces would help to limit biodiversity
risks. Without an answer to this question, this paper offers a welcome
first step but is by itself of little use to policymakers who are
contemplating potential market interventions.
