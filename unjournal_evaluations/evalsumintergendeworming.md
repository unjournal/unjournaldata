# *Abstract* 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Intergenerational Child
Mortality Impacts of Deworming: Experimental Evidence from Two Decades
of the Kenya Life Panel Survey"[@nrvvmwr3tnr]. The authors find evidence
for an intergenerational mortality benefit that could be large enough to
make a difference to the debate over the effectiveness of deworming
(relative to other impactful interventions like bednets). The evaluators
generally find the paper credible, but raise some concerns (e.g., about
consistency with the pre-analysis plan) and request some robustness
checks. The authors responded briefly, noting they are revising the
paper in response to these and other comments. To read these
evaluations, please see the links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

A well-written and coherent paper. One of the first showing
intergenerational effects of childhood health intervention in \[a\]
LMIC, including cost-benefit analysis. Statistical power calculation not
provided. Literature review is slightly one-sided. Some results in
tables could be discussed further in text. Some typical outcomes
\[were\] not present (nor mentioned), \[... and \] if \[they\] exist in
the data \[it\] would be interesting to see them.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

This is a highly credible and important analysis of the
intergenerational effects of a Kenyan deworming intervention. Such
effects are important to document because they could meaningfully affect
the cost-benefit analysis of such programs and also teach us about the
mechanisms through which parents transmit advantage to their children.
However, the analysis would be more credible if the authors were
transparent about their deviations from the pre-analysis plan, which
include the addition of (and exclusion of) outcomes and changes to the
empirical specification. Also, more information on the "first
stage"---the impact of randomization on receipt of deworming
treatment---would be helpful.

# Unjournal process notes 

## Why we chose this paper

*From the prioritization assessor*

> This paper has the potential to be highly influential and very
> important.

Some concerns were raised about potential lack of vetting or
replication.

There is substantial debate over the effectiveness of deworming relative
to other impactful interventions like bednets. Evidence for the
effectiveness of deworming seems to be far more uncertain with much
greater confidence intervals than for other interventions. Previous
work, particularly that focusing on the long-term impact, seems to be
inconsistent, or in some cases seemed face-value implausible. See fairly
non-technical discussions:\
[GiveWell\'s updated estimate of deworming and decay --- EA
Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mwzaMM6ZXYRaxXK8p/givewell-s-updated-estimate-of-deworming-and-decay "null")

<https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/7/19/23268786/deworming-givewell-effective-altruism-michael-hobbes>

And GiveWell's recommendation change: [Evidence Action\'s Deworm the
World Initiative -- August 2022
version](https://www.givewell.org/charities/deworm-world-initiative/August-2022-version "null")

More evidence and more synthesis, and more careful scrutiny would seem
to be high value; the magnitude of the estimates of the impact of
deworming, and our confidence in these estimates seems pivotal to
driving charitable funding and intervention recommendations.

The intergenerational mortality benefit seems substantial enough in
magnitude to make a difference as confirmed by the paper authors, and by
a very quick chat GPT-assisted back-of-the-envelope calculation and
review. (See

## Evaluation process

This evaluation process took longer than normal/desirable. We
prioritized this for evaluation on Dec. 18, 2023. The initially assigned
evaluation manager was overloaded, and we needed to change. We
commissioned three evaluations, one of which did not meet our standards
for posting (lack of detail, some misunderstandings). We also had some
delays in finding relevant evaluators in this area.

The authors engaged with this process, sharing a brief response (linked
in this package), and suggesting that they intend to respond further as
a new version of the paper is released. We allowed the evaluators to
adjust their content to this response. E2 modified their report very
slightly, but neither evaluator chose to change their ratings.

    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have

[^5]: This evaluator used a sllightly different (newer) evaluation form;
    see notes below.

[^6]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^7]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\
    \
    This was on the newer form only

[^8]: The randomized design makes the results highly credible

[^9]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^10]: This paper makes a strong advancement, although other papers
    suggest such intergenerational effects were likely

[^11]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to
    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^12]: Changes from pre-analysis plan should be noted

[^13]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^14]: Very well-written and clear

[^15]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^16]: The authors have posted the data:
    <https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/KLPS>

[^17]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^18]: The latter ratings were merged in the new form, which Eval. 2
    used.\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus

    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^19]: Highly relevant
