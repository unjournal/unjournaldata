# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Universal Basic Income:
Short-Term Results from a Long-Term Experiment in
Kenya"[@{https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/papers/UBI_main_paper.pdf
}]. The paper presents an important (and impressive) randomized
controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates the impact of different timing
structures of unconditional cash transfers (or universal basic income)
in Kenya.​[^1] Both evaluations agree that the work is likely to make a
critical impact on what works in poverty reduction or alleviation within
the realm of development economics. The first evaluator, coming from a
policy background, suggested the results -- involving multiple outcome
comparisons across multiple arms -- could be presented more clearly. We,
the managers suspect an online dashboard would be particularly helpful
here. They also requested "an explicit comparison of (income+asset)
gains to transfer costs for policymakers". The second evaluation
highlighted causal inference issues, self-reporting bias, and the
limitations of this study for considering generalized UBI in macro
equilibrium . They argue that the claims around the effects of UBI on
well-being and consumption merit a more careful explanation of
mechanisms; they suggest the authors could use aspects of program design
(e.g., access to mental health services etc.) to decompose these
effects. *To read these evaluations, please see the links below.*

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^2]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").)
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

*AI generated abstract:* This Unjournal evaluation reviews a very large,
policy‑relevant RCT in rural Kenya that tests three ways to deliver
equivalent unconditional cash: a one‑time \$3,000 lump sum; a \$3,000
two‑year "UBI"; and a two‑year transfer with a promise of ten additional
years (\~\$15,000) of payments. At \~23,000 treated adults and an
estimated \~\$70M program cost, the evaluator judges the study
exceptionally rigorous and useful for governments and NGOs. Core
takeaways: no clear reduction in labor supply or increase in
"temptation" spending; no compelling evidence of village‑level price
inflation (estimates are imprecise); and economic gains from the lump
sum are similar to, and sometimes larger than, those from the long‑term
UBI---consistent with severe credit constraints that ongoing small
transfers do not relax. The report praises design clarity (including a
pre‑analysis plan) but critiques result presentation, recommending a
compact cross‑arm summary table and an explicit comparison of
(income+asset) gains to transfer costs for policymakers.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

*\[Strengths\]*

-   Rigorous large-scale RCT design

-   Simple yet effective statistical approach

-   (Mostly) outstanding statistical analysis/interpretation & clear
    communication + Insightful analysis of cash-transfer effects in
    development context

*\[Limitations\]*

-   Limited relevance for generalized UBI in macro equilibrium

-   Potential biases in self-reported data, which is insufficiently
    discussed

-   Additional socio-economic context would enhance understanding

-   Some statistical results and interpretations from the paper remain
    unclear

# Evaluation manager's discussion

The paper presents an important (and impressive) randomized controlled
trial (RCT) that evaluates the impact of different timing structures of
unconditional cash transfers (or universal basic income) in Kenya.​ There
are two important aspects of the paper that make it suitable for
evaluation at The Unjournal: the first is the clear linkage to global
priorities research and the fact that the authors include individuals
from GiveDirectly, an NGO providing UCTs globally and generating an
evidence-based approach for giving. The second is that from a knowledge
perspective, the findings need to be critically evaluated to better
understand what we can learn from RCTs on UBI in the context of Kenya.
Given that RCTs are typically considered the "gold standard" of evidence
(not just in economics or policy research, but increasingly among policy
stakeholders in the Global South).

The study compares three arms: a lump sum transfer, a UBI over two
years, and a two-year transfer with the promise of ten years of
additional transfers. ​ Each participant received \$3,000 in transfers
over the study period, with the long-term arm expecting an additional
\$15,000. ​ The RCT aims to understand how the timing of transfers
affects the outcomes, such as work behavior and investment decisions. As
Evaluator 1 points out, the study\'s scale is noteworthy, with nearly
23,000 treated adults and a cost of approximately USD 70 million, making
it more comparable to a government program than a standard economics
RCT. ​ The findings have implications for policymakers designing benefit
structures and organizations like GiveDirectly, who routinely produce
evidence at varied levels that could also serve as avenues for future
evaluation of applied work at The Unjournal. Evaluating this paper,
therefore, gives us an opportunity to better situate such policy
evidence in the context of other similar work at GiveDirectly and other
non-profits.

Both evaluations agree that the work is likely to make a critical impact
on what works in poverty reduction or alleviation within the realm of
development economics. The second evaluation especially highlights some
of the concerns around causal inference from the claims made by the
authors, and provides useful insights on how best to consider these. In
particular, the claims around the effects of UBI on well-being and
consumption merit some more careful explanation of mechanisms ---
perhaps the authors could use some aspects of program design (e.g.,
access to mental health services etc.) to decompose these effects. There
are also many other useful comments from the second evaluator on what
the authors could meaningfully consider for improving the paper either
as part of the current project itself or as future work.

## Other notes

One of the evaluators is a field specialist on The Unjournal's team.
However, they were not part of the decision to prioritize this paper for
evaluation.

[^3]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: This is a very large, extremely expensive RCT on how the timing of
    payments in unconditional cash transfers affects the outcomes. It is
    extremely impressive, and I suspect will be influential on both
    policymakers, as well as influencing future decisions by the
    implementing NGO. I expect this to publish well, as it should; it is
    clean, well-identified work that answers important questions. There
    are relatively few surprises here - UCTs work, and extremely poor
    people are credit constrained - but it is nonetheless a very good
    study. Novelty need not be everything; it is useful to see how
    things operate at (some) scale.

[^6]: I mainly think of development/RTC papers in general, rather than
    of \'UBI\' studies.

[^7]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^8]: This is a spectacularly large and expensive RCT. I think it
    contributes substantially to both GiveDirectly\'s likely future
    practice (perhaps focusing more on lump sums and less on payments
    over time), and is likely to contribute to policy-making decisions.
    The lower end of this credible interval is simply because this
    experiment is so costly it may be difficult for even policy makers
    to replicate - few developing country governments can make credible
    commitments for 12 years.

[^9]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^10]: This is a pre-registered RCT where the PAP is clearly linked in
    the text.

[^11]: Despite a few potential shortcomings, overall the papers is
    rather outstanding in its methodological rigour.

[^12]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^13]: This is probably the paper\'s biggest weakness; despite the
    relatively straightforward design, it is sometimes difficult to
    follow what the effects in each arm were. I think a summary table of
    relative effect size for each outcome measure (e.g. smallest,
    largest) would be extremely helpful in following. There are also
    some minor issues with concept definitions - e.g. ROSCA is used
    before it is defined.

[^14]: Mostly highly transparent & logically explained, however, in some
    occasions insufficient detail for reader to understand/judge well.

[^15]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^16]: While I did not review the replication materials, RCTs are
    generally straightforward to replicate. The method of randomization
    and stratification are clear.

[^17]: Nope, data, code, and some statistical details are not indicated.
    Information about distributions of raw observations mostly absent.

[^18]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^19]: UBIs are an active topic of policy discussion, and have been
    implemented by governments (if only as pilots) in rich countries.
    Some developing country governments are also experimenting with
    unconditional cash transfers (e.g. Togo during COVID). These
    results, particularly those that compare a short-term UBI to a
    similar-sized lump sum, are likely to inform these decisions. I
    could imagine governments choosing a single lump sum transfer
    partially based on this paper.

[^20]: Despite some reservations with regards to validity of results for
    \"UBI\" in more general, high relevance of findings for development
    context cash-transfer programs.

[^21]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^22]: For most moral weights, cash transfers are dominated by other
    interventions. GiveWell estimates that for the their moral weights,
    their health interventions are \~10x better than GiveDirectly\'s
    cash transfers. Even if you weigh health much less highly than
    GiveWell, there are likely better income interventions (e.g.
    migration subsidies). This paper provides more information about the
    impact of cash transfers. This could be useful in providing a better
    baseline to compare highly effective interventions against, but
    GiveDirectly is still unlikely to be competitive with the most
    cost-effective interventions.

[^23]: Difficulty to judge on an absolute scale, as this requires
    comparing with a not well-defined universe of papers beyond the
    current field.

[^24]: While this paper makes few theoretical innovations, this is
    policy-relevant work based on a spectacularly large (and expensive)
    RCT. If the AER and other top 5 journals wish to contribute to
    policy discussion, this paper should be published in such journals.

[^25]: The stature of the authors (Banerjee in particular) and cost of
    this RCT seem likely to result in a top tier journal placement.
