# Abstract 

I greatly appreciated the *Ends vs Means* paper, especially its effort
to bring moral dilemmas into economics. I see two main limitations in
the current version of the paper: (1) the Save a Life dilemma may
mischaracterize Kant's categorical imperative; (2) the finding of
unstable deontological preferences may depend on the dilemmas used. I
hope these issues will be resolved, as I think this paper has high
potential.

# Written report

I have genuinely enjoyed the Ends vs Means paper by Bénabou, Falk, and
Henkel. I am really glad that moral dilemmas between deontology and
consequentialism are beginning to attract the interest of economists. I
think this was an important aspect that was missing in the economic
modeling of human behavior. From this perspective, my expectation (and
perhaps also my hope) is that this study will help bring moral reasoning
more fully into mainstream economic discourse.

At the same time, I have identified a few shortcomings that I hope can
be addressed either in a revision of the paper or in future research.
Below, I outline the three main points that emerged as I read.

### \[1. The "Save a Life dilemma" does not isolate Kant's categorical imperative of not using humans solely as a means to an end\][^4]

1\) My main comment regards the Save a Life dilemma. As the authors
correctly note, this decision is essentially equivalent to a standard
switch-track trolley problem. However, I believe the underlying
deontological principle differs from Kant's categorical imperative of
not using humans solely as a means to an end. Rather, it aligns more
closely with Aquinas\'s \"doctrine of double effect\", according to
which causing harm as a side effect can be morally acceptable if that is
not the intended effect. Everett, Pizarro, and Crockett
(2016)[@nb0fh3a79lx] have a thorough discussion about the different
principles at play in various trolley problems. To isolate Kant\'s
imperative, one can use the trapdoor dilemma, where the moral dilemma
involves opening an electric trapdoor via a remote control, through
which a large man gets thrown on the tracks. I recognize that it is hard
to build an incentivized version of this dilemma, but this is ultimately
the reason why moral psychologists are sticking to hypothetical
scenarios: some of the most interesting cases are really hard, and
perhaps impossible, to incentivize.

### \[2. The 'instability of deontological preferences' may not generalize\]

2\) My second comment regards the result that there does not seem to be
stable deontological preferences in the authors' dataset. I was
wondering how generalizable this is and whether this depends on the
particular dilemmas considered. For instance, if we were to consider
personal moral dilemmas in which one needs to directly harm someone to
save a greater number of people (think of the footbridge dilemma, where
one has to decide whether to push a large man off the bridge to stop the
trolley), I would intuitively say that deontological preferences would
be much more stable in this case, as they would be highly correlated
with relatively stable psychological traits like reliance on intuition
or reliance on deliberation. In this regard, I think one important point
to highlight is that deontological preferences represent a class of
preferences, and not a single type, depending on the underlying
deontological moral rule(s). There are many deontological rules and the
fact that preferences over one or some of these rules are not stable
does not imply that preferences over each of these rules are unstable.
It is possible that preference for not inflicting direct harm, or for
not using humans solely as means to an end, are more stable.

### \[3. Related literature that should be noted\]

3\) My final comment regards the related literature. The authors'
results are fascinating, however, some aspects are not entirely novel.
In particular, I felt personally reassured that the authors did not find
correlations between deontological decisions and prosociality in
economic games. This extends a result of mine, where I found no
significant correlations between deontological decisions in the trapdoor
dilemma and prosocial decisions in the dictator and trust games (Capraro
et al., 2018)[@ns2xupixhys]. I have also appreciated the relationship
between various forms of prosociality and the reference to the brilliant
work of Chapman et al. However, there is an earlier paper by
Peysakhovich, Nowak, and Rand (2014)[@nnpego7j4ul] making a very similar
point, which I think should be mentioned. There are also two
experimental papers showing a positive correlation between not telling
Pareto white lies and giving in the dictator game and cooperating in the
prisoner\'s dilemma. These results are very hard to explain using
consequentialist preferences and can be seen as a first attempt at
showing the existence of deontological preferences using incentivized
decisions (Biziou-van-Pol et al., 2015 [@nnbpxyi53rl]; Cappelen et al.,
2013)[@nbt231aq90g]. Finally, I would like to mention a JEL review of
moral preferences models, touching on many of the points that the
authors make in their article (Capraro, Halpern & Perc,
2024)[@n36kxc4wrlt].
