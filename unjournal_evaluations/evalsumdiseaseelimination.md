# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Economic vs.
Epidemiological Approaches to Measuring the Human Capital Impacts of
Infectious Disease Elimination\".[@nwn0qjtf83x] To read these
evaluations, please see the links below.

## **Evaluations**

1\. [Anonymous evaluator

2\. [Anonymous evaluator

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^1]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").)
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

This evaluator did not provide a summary. We present the following
summary list (written with some assistance from AI tools; see [this
chatbot conversation](https://poe.com/s/4A0WCI1e3vFPT6ZA4LqK "null") for
context).

*Positives*:

\(1\) Novel epidemiological method for imputing historical infection
rates.

\(2\) Interesting comparison of epidemiological vs economic approaches.

*Limitations/suggestions: *

(3)* *Conclusion favoring the economic approach needs stronger support.

\(4\) Concerned about identifying assumptions for 'sharp cohort design'
--- would like to see tests for 'no cohort pre-trends'.

\(5\) Needs more discussion of conceptual differences between mortality
and infection rates.

\(6\) Could elaborate more on applicability to other diseases*.*

## Anonymous evaluator 2

This paper presents an interesting comparison of two methods for
estimating the impact of measles on long-term health and economic
outcomes: an epidemiological model to estimate variation in measles
infection across cohorts and, as more standard in economics, a
reduced-form model that uses variation in pre-vaccination measles
mortality across place. It is a fascinating and important study that
highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches. However,
pushing a bit further on the assumptions and measurement issues
associated with each approach and having a fuller explanation of the
differences in the empirical results would make for an even stronger
contribution.

# Evaluation manager's discussion[^16]

The evaluators make several suggestions that could improve the paper.

Evaluator 1 points out that the paper is lacking an event study to test
for differential cohort trends. One would like to see evidence of an
absence of pre-trends and an absence of effects for cohorts too old to
benefit from the vaccine (perhaps trends with tight statistical bounds
around zero).

They also ask why the measles fatality rate would vary geographically.
Since almost everyone was infected with measles in the pre-vaccine era,
variation in mortality would seem to be driven by initial health levels
or quality of health care; moreover, variation in reported measles cases
could be driven by reporting capacity. (This raises questions about how
to interpret the treatment variation in Atwood 2022
[@temp_id_10722812197990406], which uses reported measles incidence.)

Finally, they ask how the epidemiological approach could be applied to
other infectious diseases.

Evaluator 2 focuses on the relationship between measles mortality rates
and infection rates. Given that the reduced-form results here (using
mortality) agree with Atwood 2022 (using incidence), we would naturally
expect mortality and infection rates to be positively correlated.
However, this correlation is not reported, and the subsample presented
in Figure 4 in fact suggests a *negative* correlation. The authors
should be clearer in distinguishing their contribution from Atwood, and
explaining why the reduced-form results agree.

Lastly, it is surprising that the results from the epidemiological model
change sign when including cohort fixed effects, when the model shows
credibility through predicting future outbreaks.

# Unjournal process notes 

I (David Reinstein) served as the evaluation manager and guided
correspondence with the authors. However, I benefitted from strong and
detailed advice from several members of The Unjournal's team who have a
greater familiarity with this research area.

## Why we chose this paper[^17] 

 This paper studies the long-term effects of the 1963 US measles
vaccine, and is relevant for funding vaccines in developing countries. 

This line of research holds potential for improving our understanding of
how to measure vaccine effects. This work might cause updates in claims
about the importance of vaccine rollouts or research.

## Evaluation process and suggestions for evaluation 

We shared the following content with evaluators.

**Why does it need (more) review, and what are some key issues and
claims to vet?**

1.  The paper seems to interpret its finding as supporting the
    reduced-form approach. From the abstract: "Our results suggest that
    differences in disease severity are more relevant for long-term
    human capital impacts than raw differences in actual infection
    rates, supporting the reduced-form approach used in the economic
    literature."

2.  Their reduced-form approaching the literature  uses reported
    incidence. Pre-vaccine mortality could arguably be a proxy for
    this.  But the authors don't seem to consider whether pre-vaccine
    mortality correlates with reported incidence. *Does this matter?*

3.  The authors claim that reported incidence is a proxy for disease
    burden. Is this justified? Could they test this empirically?

4.  How does the concept of  'disease burden' apply to a universal
    disease like measles (with nearly 100% infection rates). In light of
    this, what is the identifying variation?

5.  Do the authors clearly state their identifying assumptions? Is their
    identification justified?

6.  They do not present an event study to test for pre-trends --- is
    this an important limitation?

## Author engagement

The authors responded to our initial note about evaluating their paper,
shared their most recent draft, and offered useful feedback on our
process. We shared the evaluations with them, and they acknowledged that
they found the comments and suggestions interesting, and agreed with
most of them. They decided not to write an authors' response, but noted
that they may consider a response in future.
