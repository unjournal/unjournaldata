We would like to thank the editors for commissioning this review and the
evaluators for not only conducting such a thorough and thoughtful
evaluation of the paper, but also providing an extensive write-up and
some precise recommendations on how to improve it. We note that not all
co-authors have reviewed this response.

We have revised the working version of the paper. As part of this latest
revision we tried to address the evaluators' comments which we believed
were in the scope for this paper.

In this document we attempt to summarize the changes and also provide
some replies to points raised by the evaluators. We use shorthand E1 for
Evaluation 1 (Sharma Waddington and Masset) and E2 for Evaluation 2
(unknown reviewer).

The first section of this document covers topics raised in the
evaluations for which we either implemented changes to the paper or
which we thought simply required a clarification. We grouped comments
under 13 headings, ordered \[...\] to match the paper.

Towards the end of this document, we include a section of changes that
we are still working on, mainly to do with inclusion/exclusion of
studies and evaluation (risk of bias, PRISMA). We were not able to
complete these in a short timeframe, since in some cases they require
additional paper reviews, data extraction, and consequently re-running
the analyses. We will make a new version with these updates available in
the near future. The current replies should therefore be treated as
provisional, as we are still working on revising our paper.

While E1 was broadly in favor of conducting \[a\] review of evidence on
child mortality and water treatment, E2 suggested that the paper would
benefit from an alternative framing: in short, because "everyone
recognizes \[water treatment\] as a high priority investment area", we
should consider which type of intervention is appropriate for which
context.

We have adjusted the framing in response to the reviewer E2\'s comments.
However, we would argue that this study is decision relevant, even for
policymakers who already recognize that clean water is a high priority
investment area.

First, there are many high priority investment areas which policymakers
need to allocate funding between. Even if policymakers already consider
water treatment to be a priority area, the degree of cost-effectiveness
is still decision relevant. Second, there is heterogeneity among policy
makers. Some have very high cost-effectiveness thresholds, either
explicitly or implicitly due to limited resources. As we demonstrate in
the discussion, an alternative model without empirical results on
mortality (and extrapolated to mortality reductions from reductions in
diarrhea and some additional assumptions on share of deaths due to
diarrhea) estimates a much lower magnitude of reductions, which might
not meet some cost-effectiveness thresholds.

Third, some child survival funders may require statistically significant
experimental evidence on mortality, which this meta-analysis provides.

Fourth, this meta-analysis provides evidence that even in the absence of
complementary sanitation interventions, water treatment can have a large
impact on child mortality, a question about which there has been
substantial uncertainty.

We therefore think an estimate of reductions in mortality based directly
on mortality data is policy relevant. Indeed, at least one donor has
made substantial investments in water treatment and one national
government has changed its policy on water treatment after seeing this
evidence.

See also below for further thoughts on the framing of the
cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA).

E1 discusses pre-registration, stating that "a pre-analysis plan was
submitted to the AEA registry in June 2020". However, this was only a
study registration, not a study *plan* registration. This study was
originally conducted as an exploratory analysis based on existing
reviews and our own systematic review component was added later on: as
per the [study registration at
AEA](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5977), "We first
review all papers identified by Clasen et al. (2015) and Wolf et al.
(2018) for their meta-analyses of the impact of interventions to improve
water quality on diarrhea which covers studies from 1970 up to February
2016. Next, we replicate their selection criteria and search procedure
for the period from February 2016 to May 2020 to add more recent
studies."

We provided more context for this at the start of the Methods section in
the main text.

We also note that previous versions of the paper have been assessed
using PRISMA and we are working on updating that assessment, which we
will include in a future journal submission. This will clearly state
that the review was not pre-registered.

## 3. Systematic review period and included studies

E2 points out that the period of systematic review search was unclear.
We have now fixed that; the systematic search finished in May 2020.

We discuss inclusion/exclusion of studies (and the criteria for it)
elsewhere in this document.

There was a question from E2 on whether the effects are not diluted due
to under-5 (U5) mortality decreasing over time. Since the meta-analysis
model calculates reductions in odds ratios (ORs) on a relative scale,
impacts on mortality are assumed to scale with baseline mortality in the
model. The CEA accounts for this by using realistic, up-to-date values
of baseline mortality in each implementation case study. It is important
for any potential implementers to calculate benefits using mortality
from their specific context. We caution readers against extrapolating
results beyond the support of the data.

## 4. Questions about study timeframes, interpretation of effects, and sustained treatment

We focused on a 5-year timeline because we were interested in the
cost-effectiveness of sustained rather than short-run programs. If it
were known, for example, that the program would only operate for a short
period of time, then programs that involve a substantial capital
component (such as dispensers or in-line chlorination) would be less
cost-effective.

Evaluators also pointed out that interpretation of meta-analytic results
may not be straightforward, because hardly any study includes children
from birth up to age five. The model treats the relative reduction in
mortality risk as constant with age. We summarize the age-composition of
the sample in Supplementary Information, section "Age characteristics of
included children". We find that all age groups are well-represented,
although with a slight skew toward under-2s (since some larger studies
did not include older children).

Separately we are looking into conducting a future survival model
analysis of individual-level data to understand potential variation in
treatment effects with age. In exploratory analyses that we conducted so
far, we have not been able to find any evidence on effects varying with
age group, although statistical power for such analyses is limited.

## 5. More complete information on weights, pooling, heterogeneity, subgroups

E2 pointed out that \[the\] calculation of \[the\] weights was not
explained for the frequentist model. E1 also inquired about the weights.
All of the weights (frequentist and Bayesian) are available in Table S4.
We will attempt to revise Figure 2 to include these if there is enough
space to fit them on plots.

We currently report on the extent of heterogeneity for both frequentist
and Bayesian models in the main text. They are not shown in the plots
for the same reason (readability). We also believe that the typical way
in which heterogeneity is reported (e.g. point estimate\[s\] of $I^2$
statistic\[s\]) can lead to false confidence in models, since that
estimate is often uncertain: therefore, we focus on reporting both the
point estimate of the heterogeneity parameter (i.e. between-study
standard deviation) and its 95% intervals, which turn out to be fairly
wide.

There is also more commentary on pooling in the supplement (see next
reply), which should give readers additional context.

> E1: Regarding the meta-analysis that was conducted, the review reports

> effect size.

We did not include the subgroup effect for filtration, as we believe
that for three studies it is not worth characterizing the mean effect
and filtration is not the focus of our paper.

## 6. Large "differences" in Bayesian estimates

E2 and E1 pointed to extreme OR values for some studies. E1 commented on
large differences between Bayesian and frequentist results.

This was mainly an issue with presentation: the models actually agree
with each other very well. The main reason for this confusion, we
believe, is that Figure 2A showed OR *inputs* and Figure 2B shows
study-level *posteriors*. While this is somewhat unconventional, we
wanted to highlight the amount of pooling to a common mean by
contrasting the two plots. We provided better descriptions in the
revised paper and have revised Figure 2 to avoid confusion. We are
working on preparing a separate figure that would contrast inputs with
posteriors.

The issue of different versions of the paper using different ORs are due
to us updating calculation of ORs to be consistent across all studies,
by fitting Bayesian logistic models that allow for clustered
randomisation in clustered RCTs (c-RCTs). See below for more details.

We tried to explain all of this better by adding several paragraphs in
the supplement and a few sentences of commentary in the main text.

For full transparency, we thought it best to summarize these issues for
readers of this document step by step. We hope the following summary is
helpful. To start with, let us make a few clarifying comments about
pooling of study effects towards the common mean:

-   By pooling, we mean the weight on global mean vs the individual
    study. Pooling of 1 means the study effect is the same as the global
    mean (\"full\" \"borrowing\" of information), and pooling of 0 means
    each study is not affected by other studies (no information is
    borrowed from other studies).

-   Random-effects is a model which allows pooling between 0 and 1 by
    introducing $\tau^2$ , a heterogeneity parameter. \[The\] True
    treatment effect in each study is normally distributed around the
    common mean $\mu$*,* with variance $\tau^2$ *.* (In contrast to the
    fully pooled fixed-effects model with $\tau$ set to zero, where each
    study has the same true effect, $\mu$ *.*) The true effect is always
    observed with noise, as a pair\[ing\] of \[a\] point estimate and
    its standard error (SE). Pooling of a study with a given SE is equal
    to $1 - \tau^2 / (\tau^2 + se^2)$ .

-   In our paper, the Bayesian model calculates pooling from 0.57 (Null
    et al, biggest study we have) to about 1 (Quick et al, study with
    zero deaths). 10 studies have pooling in excess of 0.9. These
    studies have low information and are thus pooled strongly towards
    the common mean.

-   The pooling concept is the same in frequentist models, but is
    typically not calculated or reported, because doing so is more
    difficult and less of a convention. However, there is little
    difference between frequentist vs Bayesian models in this regard.

-   In fact in our frequentist model (using the REML estimator),
    estimated pooling is 1 for all studies (estimate of heterogeneity is
    zero). So the differences between inputs and outputs are more
    extreme in the frequentist context. As we comment in the main text,
    this snapping to zero is a known behavior in many frequentist
    estimators of heterogeneity.

-   Pooling in our Bayesian model is not driven by priors, since we use
    very mild Bayesian priors for the global effect and heterogeneity.
    We would need (unrealistically) strong priors for $\mu$ and $\tau$
    to meaningfully affect the estimation of global parameters.

The second, related issue, is over how input odds ratios are obtained
for the model in the first place, regardless of how the estimation of
the common mean is implemented.

-   We use a Bayesian logistic model with cluster random-effects, with
    mild priors on effects in *individual studies* to obtain valid input
    ORs which avoid zeros (important when there are no deaths in control
    or treatment arms). This leads to extreme input values like OR = 24
    in the case of Luby et al 2006 (2 deaths in T, 0 in C).

-   Frequentists may use continuity corrections in such cases, i.e. add
    an arbitrary number (like 0.25) to each count, or they may or use
    another estimator like Peto odds ratios. These approaches will also
    give high odds ratios, of about 4.5-5.0. Note that the frequentist
    procedure provides more shrinkage towards no effect (OR=1) than the
    Bayesian procedure that we use.

-   Whether that study effect value is 4.5 or 24 has practically no
    influence on the estimated global effect or even the posterior
    estimate of the effect in the particular study, because studies like
    these have very high SEs and convey almost zero information. In that
    sense, while the Bayesian prior brings the estimated
    context-specific effect with pooling from infinite to 24, it has
    little effect of the estimated global estimate, and since pooling
    for this study is greater than 0.9, on the posterior for the
    context-specific effect either.

-   In section 3 of the supplement we conduct a sensitivity analysis
    using the continuity corrections to obtain input ORs (for
    individually randomized studies) and we can see that it does indeed
    not substantially affect the results.

## 7. Differences between drafts

On a related note, E1 points out that OR estimates changed across
subsequent drafts, by more than 0.08 for six studies and 0.04-0.08 for
another three. In a couple of cases this is likely due to corrected
counts in non-events (as far as we recall, numbers of deaths have not
changed during any of our reviews).

Most of these differences are due to our replacing the Peto. odds ratio
estimator, which does not allow for clustering with the Bayesian
logistic model (see summary above and details given in Supporting
Information). In a couple of cases these differences may arise due to
clustering corrections, but in most it may be because relatively little
information is contained in each study.

Note that for study sizes included in the meta-analysis even small
perturbations in counts (e.g. continuity correction of 0.25) would have
large effects on mean OR estimate (in excess of 0.05 or even 0.10).

We grouped three important points made by E1, as they are all related.

In the new version we clarified that a large majority of the studies
were in countries that were low-income at the time that studies were
conducted. Details are in Supporting Information, section 1. For study
characteristics, we have included as much information as we thought
possible in Table 1, without risking making it unreadable. We provide a
more complete summary of study characteristics in the first section of
the supplement; while we also include a short summary in the main text,
we opted for a more complete discussion in the supplement due to word
limits for the future journal submission.

We agree that there is potential for site selection biases. While we
cannot claim that the study is representative along all dimensions, we
believe the crucial dimension here (and one for which we have data to
assess representativeness) is diarrhea prevalence. We assess it not at a
country level, but at the level of sub-national units where the water
treatment in the representative group of countries (over 43,000
observations from 94 countries, based on 2020 data from IHME) and find
it representative: "Household surveys across 94 low- and middle-income
countries found diarrhea prevalence in 2017 ranging from 0.2% to 56.7%
across sub national units, with a median of 13.7% (3). Diarrhea
prevalence rates (at baseline or, if baseline not available, in the
control group) in our sample of studies range from 5% to 58%, with a
weighted mean (using meta-analytic weights from the frequentist model)
of 15.6%; this corresponds to the 61st percentile of the distribution of
sub-national diarrhea estimates, see Figure S6."

We hope that based on the current phrasing in the main text, it will be
clear to the readers what the studies are representative of (e.g. "We
found studies to be representative of diarrhea prevalence in LMICs" in
the main text, with more detail given in the supplement).

E1 discusses these topics in detail. We agree of course that
adherence/compliance over a sufficient time horizon are a crucial driver
of benefits of these interventions and are grateful for such a detailed
discussion.

As a broader comment, it may be helpful to consider two parts of the
paper separately. In the first part, meta-analysis, our objective is to
find the impact of water treatment on mortality, while characterizing
take-up in existing studies. In the second part, CEA, we use the
estimates to consider impacts in specific settings. To address the fact
that the average take-up is likely higher than what may be expected in
many large-scale implementations (of point-of-use or
point-of-collection) by adjusting in the CEA for relative compliance,
assuming effects scale in proportion to take-up. For example, if
effective take-up of dispensers is 36%, we assume that mortality
reductions scale down linearly by 0.36/0.54 etc (see Table S7 for
details).

One possible conclusion from this analysis is that water treatment is
cost-effective enough that policymakers may wish to make water treatment
available free to households with young children and that in many
contexts, it\'s likely to be worthwhile to provide water treatment in
forms that require minimal behavior of change, and thus are likely to
achieve high usage rates. This would indeed entail minimizing burdens on
caregivers of water treatment, for example by providing clean piped
water to households. In that sense, our analysis is based on the premise
that one can learn about the underlying effect of water treatment from
controlled experiments and they should not be interpreted as supporting
any particular path to water treatment. The appropriate path is likely
to depend at least in part on context, but our analysis suggests that
some type of water treatment is likely to be appropriate in a wide range
of contexts.

We have a few more clarifying comments:

1.  We try to align definitions of adherence across studies, especially
    for chlorination, where we use objective measurements. This is
    detailed in Supporting Information, section 1. Given different
    lengths of studies, many of which are shorter than a year, these
    measurements typically do not address the question of persistence,
    but we hope that our approach will be transparent to the readers.

2.  Observer effects discussed by the evaluators are indeed very likely
    to increase take-up in experiments. Our meta-analytic estimate is
    specific to the take-up in the included studies. As we point out in
    the main text, the weighted average of effective take-up in our
    sample was 54% (about 56% in treatment vs about 3% in controls).

3.  Perhaps most importantly, in the new version of the paper, we also
    construct alternative CE calculations that assume lower compliance
    for each of the three methods, which we hope demonstrates the
    crucial role that ensuring compliance plays in successful
    implementations of water treatment. These are presented in
    Discussion and in expanded Table S7. We hope this is done
    transparently and in a way that allows readers who make their own
    judgements about the fraction of the population that will treat
    water to make their own calculation of cost-effectiveness.

Different decision makers prefer different cost-effectiveness
thresholds. It's beyond the scope of our paper to review the debate on
the appropriateness of various thresholds. As such, we aimed to choose
two different thresholds (one high and one low) to illustrate that water
treatment is cost-effective on a wide range of thresholds, and indicate
where decision makers might make different decisions about
implementation.

E2 suggested constructing and presenting cost estimates in ways that
allow policymakers to construct CE analyses that are specific to their
circumstances (as well as generally making CEA more applicable to
specific contexts).

We agree that this would be valuable. We provide a detailed breakdown of
cost calculation in footnotes to Table S7 (expanded CEA table) and hope
to create a setting-specific CE calculator. However, this would require
data on locally specific factors such as the cost of materials which
will be available to policymakers for their area. We do not have
sufficient data to do this. We believe this is out of scope of this
paper and most useful as a stand-alone tool.

E1 also noted a lack of uncertainty intervals in CEA results and that
Standard economic theory suggests that policymakers should be modeled as
risk-neutral in this context. The standard justification for risk
aversion is concavity in the utility function over consumption. The per
person cost of water treatment is low enough relative to per capita
income that risk neutrality seems appropriate to use a first order
approximation to the utility function.

We also argue that our analysis suggests that water treatment is
sufficiently cost-effective to be robust to more conservative
assumptions. In the supplement we conduct further cost-effectiveness
analysis for a decision maker with an informative prior centered around
a 3.9% reduction in the odds of mortality. This may be helpful for a
reader interested in the cost-effectiveness of water treatment assuming
smaller effect sizes.

E1 also noted that the global result was used instead of the
chlorination sub-group result.

We believe that using the results across all studies is appropriate,
given the lack of precision in estimates and the need to fully utilize
data. However, in this case choosing either option would not have
meaningful implications for the result, since the mean in chlorination
studies is similar to the mean across all studies.

We are very grateful for this detailed discussion and agree on the
importance of including participant flow diagrams in studies. It is
clear that in this instance having these diagrams available in all
studies would enable analysis of several studies without relying on
direct contact with researchers or analysis of individual-level data.
(Although it is important to note that the latter has an important
advantage when studies use clustered randomisation.) We added this as a
recommendation.

We re-reviewed included studies and modified the paper to discuss more
how mortality was reported and whether studies included participant flow
diagrams; we now note: "Out of the 13 studies that reported mortality in
publications: five report it as an outcome, nine include number of
deaths in a flow diagram, and five discuss or report death in the text.
Only one (23) includes mortality as an outcome in the pre-registration."

More broadly, we believe there is an important implication for reporting
of outcomes, one that goes beyond reporting of mortality, applicable to
important outcomes that may be collected by studies but are
underpowered. Multiple hypothesis testing requirements could have
unintended consequences of disincentivizing reporting such outcomes (of
which death is one) are likely to not be reported due to worries about
multiple hypothesis testing. We take the point that some study authors
may not have reported mortality for other reasons, rather than for fear
of being subjected to multiple hypothesis testing requirements.
Motivations of the authors of decades-old papers are difficult to
assess. But going forward, a policy under which authors are encouraged
to report CONSORT diagrams and submit pre-analysis plans in which they
specify that data on important outcomes for which an individual study
are underpowered would be collected for purposes of meta-analysis and
the individual papers are not expected to include multiple hypothesis
testing corrections would generate incentives for researchers to conduct
studies.. We are working on follow-up research that would address this
topic and think it is important to highlight these issues further.

## 13. COI statements

Thanks for this comment. We would like to clarify that

1.) Steve Luby is not a member of Evidence Action's Board, but rather
its separate Board of Advisors, which does not have any fiduciary
responsibilities to the organization.

2.) Michael Kremer helped develop the water treatment dispenser approach
discussed in the paper which Evidence Action is implementing in East
Africa. He was a board member of a deworming NGO which later transferred
its operations to Evidence Action.

We are unaware of any guidelines under which these constitute a conflict
of interest for Kremer or Luby, but will of course follow relevant
guidelines including those of the relevant journal when submitting the
paper for publication.

We also note that Evidence Action is primarily an implementing
organization rather than a campaigning organization.

E1 suggested two studies that were not considered. We reviewed them and
included one of the two.

First, we did not include Bowen et al, which was a long-term
developmental outcomes follow-up to a study we already include (Luby et
al 2006). Bowen et al has more deaths, but it follows children up to the
age of eight and most of the follow-up is after the active water
treatment period. We believe that Luby et al 2006 (for which we have
individual-level data) already includes U5 deaths from the relevant
period. For full transparency, we checked the impact of replacing the
Luby et al study with the Bowen et al study. It would reduce the mean
reduction in OR and its 95% interval by about 2-3 percentage points and
the results remain significant.

Second, we will include the Ercumen et al study in the updated analysis
and thank the evaluators for bringing this study to our attention. Since
only four deaths occurred in that study (2 in treatment arm, 2 in
control), this should have no meaningful impact on the results, but it's
of course important to include all available evidence.

Evaluators were right to point out that including this study contradicts
what was proposed in the AEA search strategy. We are looking into this
further and may exclude this study from the main analysis or will add a
clarification in the text to point out inconsistency with the protocol.

Regardless of what we decide, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis
specifically including/excluding that study and clearly state the
results with/without it. For the time being readers can refer to results
of Table S4 which looks at dropping individual studies from the main
analysis.

We believe no mortality data were collected during the intervention
described in this study although we are still in the process of
continuing this. Whatever mortality data exist from that program is most
likely already available in Kremer et al 2011, a study we include. We
are in the process of verifying that as well.

Many thanks to evaluators for bringing our attention to these four
studies. We are looking forward to finalizing the results as soon as
possible.

## 15. Addressing combined interventions

E1 raises the important issue of several analyzed papers having included
other interventions, such as education, cookstoves etc. We thank
evaluators for the detailed discussion of this topic. While this was
already covered in sensitivity analyses, we made sure there is stronger
emphasis on this: in the main text we explicitly list what was combined
and we added more details in supplement too:

*"In five out of the eighteen cases, water treatment was combined with
another intervention: cookstoves in Kirby et al 2019 (6), other
sanitation and hygiene interventions in Humphrey et al 2019 (7), or safe
storage in Chiller et al 2006, Peletz et al. 2012 (8), and Semenza et al
2018 (9). Quick et al. 1999 also combined safe storage and water
treatment. However, the control group also received safe storage
containers. With the exception of one treatment arm in Dupas et al 2023,
all other interventions involved some sort of educational or promotion
intervention instructing study participants on how to treat water with
the relevant method, so education is not considered a combined
intervention."*

We are working on updating our analysis in two ways. (1) Expanded
sensitivity analyses that include/exclude studies with combined
interventions. (2) New meta-regressions to also regress on treatment
combinations. While power for this will be low, several studies include
arms with e.g. hygiene interventions, education on handwashing, and safe
storage. Therefore, accounting for them in a single model may lead to
modest increases in power. In the current version of the paper the
results of sensitivity analyses have not yet been updated.

## 16. Risk of bias assessment

We thank evaluators for the discussion of mortality vs diarrhea outcomes
and their inherent risk of bias. We did not include a longer discussion
of this due to space limitations in the main text, but we agree with the
points raised. We will reconsider the overall approach to assessing
study-level risk of bias for the next version of the paper but have not
made decisions yet.

## 17. Power calculations for publication bias

E1 suggested adding a simple post-hoc power calculation to understand
\[the\] potential impacts of small study publication bias. We will
consider adding this but need to compare the two approaches before
deciding on whether to include it. We will provide additional commentary
in the supplement to better motivate the choice of this approach.

As discussed earlier, the main implication of our cost-effectiveness
analysis is that water treatment is highly cost-effective in a range of
contexts. We hope to construct a flexible tool which could produce
estimates for different contexts.

We argue that for some decision makers it is appropriate to focus on net
benefits rather than the cost-benefit ratio. We explain the rationale
for this in the supplement. We will explain this further by adding some
formal analysis in a new draft which we hope to post soon.

We have added cost per death averted back to the cost-effectiveness
table.

We are working on an update to CEA which will address some of the
suggestions for expanded scope of CE in E2. In particular, we will (1)
discuss the issue of allocating a limited health budget, (2) provide
more detail on choosing between alternative delivery methods, which is
also used to frame the discussion of cost-effectiveness analysis, and
(3) provide metrics beyond cost per DALY.

# Conclusion
