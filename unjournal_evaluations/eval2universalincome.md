# Written report[^2]

## A. On this evaluation {#a-on-this-evaluation}

My review is informed by a background in economics and policy, UBI, and
the fundamentals of statistics and econometrics. An ideal complement
could be a separate evaluation focusing more specifically on how the
paper fits into the current development economics research landscape.

Given how the paper is presented, I evaluate it with regards to three
implicit goals \[...\]:

\(i\) Informing us about economic effects from UBI in general and in a
development context in particular,

\(ii\) informing us about \[the\] effects \[of\] and the ideal design of
cash transfer programs, and

\(iii\) advancing \[the state of the art\]of RCT execution & evaluation.

According to the abstract, the paper indeed examines "What would be the
consequences of a long-term commitment to provide everyone enough money
to meet their basic needs?", and the [preregistration
registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/1952) states the
goal to also inform UBI debates in wealthy countries, including as to
whether economic security motivates their citizens to work more or less.

The various highlighted limitations with regards to the generalizability
of the study results to potential UBI settings more broadly should not
be misinterpreted as a fundamental critique of the core analysis in the
paper itself; some of the limitations could be difficult to overcome
within a cash-transfer RCT in a development context.

## B. Subjective summary of the research {#b-subjective-summary-of-the-research}

*Context*

-   The interest in universal basic income (UBI) has become increasingly
    popular during the past decades, with the [growing inequality within
    most countries
    worldwide](https://www.un.org/en/un75/inequality-bridging-divide),
    and [looming
    automation](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/ai-is-coming-for-our-jobs-could-universal-basic-income-be-the-solution)
    plausibly being contributors to the interest in the topic.

-   Given this interest, it seems a natural idea that a new RCT on cash
    transfers be designed in a way to elicit insights on the viability
    of a UBI, and, as the authors argue, with a focus on (long-term)
    effects on economic development and (market) income

-   \[...added line break\] given the difficulty to continuously finance
    a UBI in the developing world.
    [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/2023-ubi-results/)
    financed the study.

*Study*

-   RCT on poor villages in Kenya, to observe economic responses from
    cash transfer schemes of three types ("arms"): (i) one-off
    lump-sum, (ii) monthly for two years, and (iii) monthly for 12
    years. Each arm delivered a similar cumulative income transfer
    within the first two years, "suﬃcient to meet basic needs".

-   Early-stage evaluation two years into the program, finding a
    multitude of economic effects from the cash-transfers. There was
    "substantial economic expansion---more enterprises, higher revenues,
    costs, and net revenues---and structural shifts, with the expansion
    concentrated in the non-agricultural sector. Labor supply did not
    change overall but shifted out of wage employment and towards
    self-employment". The expansion was concentrated "particularly in
    retail---indeed much of the economic story appears to have been the
    expansion of supply chains to meet increased local demand for goods
    manufactured elsewhere". The value of land increased a lot, and
    "household well-being improved on some common measures (e.g. food
    consumption, depression) but not others (e.g. children's
    anthropometrics and schooling)".

-   A few differences between the arms' effects may surprise. The
    authors design a model that can theoretically explain these.

-   The authors strike a rather positive tone with regards to
    implications for UBI, and I understand this is notably due to the
    absence of a negative effect on total working hours.

## C. Strengths {#c-strengths}

-   Well-conducted large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) on
    relevant questions of increasing importance or interests.

-   Scale and spatial setup of RTC informed by careful examination of
    expectable statistical power of the analysis, and on expectable
    spillover effects between different groups.

-   Simple, yet effective statistical approach, well explained.

-   In many instances, exceptionally sober statistical interpretation of
    results: Regularly discussing the confidence interval (CI) ranges as
    opposed to only statistical significance (or absence thereof);
    focusing not just on statistical significance but also on economic
    significance of results.

-   Preregistration of study along with to-be-analyzed core variables.

-   Effective three-arm setup with different cash administration
    durations, enabling deeper insights into the subtle psychological
    and financial mechanisms at play, offering valuable insights into
    short-term and potentially long-term economic effects.

-   Treatment subjects are *individual members* of the households in the
    treatment villages. This seems a useful innovation relative to the
    more usual approach of treating *households*, whose composition can
    change over the study period.

-   Assesses a broad range of relevant outcomes, with outcome variables
    including, for example, psychological, financial/economic, and
    health results.

-   All in all, careful implementation from start to finish means not
    only reliable results are gathered, but the study can also be an
    inspiration for future work in similar and related domains.

## D. Main claims and assessment {#d-main-claims-and-assessment}

I address four major claim sets.

**1. Claims around economic expansion, structural shifts, and labor
supply:** *Communities receiving UBI showed significant economic
expansion, characterized by increased business enterprises, revenues,
and shifts from wage employment to self-employment, particularly in the
non-agricultural sectors. Total labor supply did not decrease,
indicating that UBI does not promote \"laziness\" but reallocates labor
towards more entrepreneurial activities*.

These effects are factually observed and rather robust (see Table 4).
One open question is how far they may generalize. In so far as the study
will be seen as supporting the idea that "UBI works" in \[the\] most
general sense, multiple limitations are noteworthy:

1.a) The scheme *did not first fiscally collect revenues from the local,
treated population*, for redistribution in form of an unconditional cash
transfer, as is usually thought of for a UBI scheme. Instead, the money
distributed was 'manna from heaven' for the treated population, i.e., an
inflow of external cash (from GiveDirectly). A series of macroeconomic
equilibrium effects expectable of a more standard UBI can therefore not
be observed.

1.b) Baseline wealth and size of transfer: While substantial for the
concerned households, with roughly 0.30 USD/day per person in the
household,[^3] the *transfers received seem small* even with
PPP-adjustment (0.76 USD PPP per person in the household), *when
compared to the requirements of a materially more or less decent life*,
even in the villages. The households were quite poor in the baseline
(85% experienced hunger, according to Table D.1). It can therefore not
be known to which degree the observation that the "UBI" does not weaken
labor incentives generalizes to other contexts. Arguably, it would seem
natural that less poor populations, receiving a higher UBI, might more
readily shift, after their broader basic needs \[were\] met, to unpaid
activities, reducing their wage labor supply.

1\. c) Desirability of shifts: A related question that the paper does
not discuss in much detail, is how 'positive' the observed economic
changes really are. Naturally, the transfers have a first-order effect
of allowing the households to consume more, including, for example, more
proteins. The broader "economic expansion" and "structural shifts" away
from agriculture have been overwhelmingly concentrated in the retail
sector. It therefore seems like, first and foremost, more goods,
produced elsewhere, seem to have been consumed. This may contrast with
hopes that much of the new resources would be invested \[in\] local
production of new types of goods and services. Changes in the latter
direction would have partly occurred according to point estimates,
though they were not statistically significant, and seem to have overall
been mostly quite small relative to the observed retail expansion (Table
E.9).

**2. Claims from comparison between transfer types:** *One of the most
noteworthy differences between the three arms was that the lump-sum &
long-term arms had a much larger economic expansion than the short-term
arm, while the latter instead had a larger expansion in consumption. For
mental health, the main difference was between the lump-sum and the two
regular payment arms: mental health improved significantly less in the
lump-sum arm than in the other arms.*

These conclusions seem statistically robust (Tables 2 and 9). The
question about the underlying reasons is interesting. Without presenting
it as the only potential explanation, the authors show how the smaller
economic expansion in the short-term arm can be obtained in a model with
savings and borrowing difficulties where "investment projects require
both a large up-front capital outlay and ongoing ﬂow investment to turn
a proﬁt". This is a relatively complex mechanism. I wonder whether a
much simpler, psychological explanation could be behind the results:
Receiving a larger one-off lump sum, might spur one to think seriously
of how to productively invest it; receiving regular payments for the
longer term, might also make one wonder how to best change one's life.
Receiving, instead, the limited extra income regularly for a known
shorter period of two years, might do less of either of these two
things, and may therefore instead mainly lead to an increased
consumption in the short term arm.

**3. Claims about** **psychological and consumption effects:** *UBI
increased general well-being, reduced depression, and improved nutrition
through greater food variety and protein consumption. It also increased
education spending across the three arms. Impacts on health spending
were mixed across transfer schemes.*

These effects are readily observed in the data (Table 5). They seem
mostly unsurprising, with the main question being to which degree some
of the more unexpected differences across arms (e.g. health) might be
due to statistical noise. After all, with the large number of parameters
estimated in the study, we'd expect potentially several \[...\] to
become statistically significant, potentially even with the wrong sign,
merely due to statistical coincidence.

**4. Claims about price impacts:** *"Overall we do not reject the null
that consumer prices \[in nearby markets\] were unaﬀected, in which case
the revenue increases discussed above come entirely from increased
sales, albeit with fairly wide conﬁdence intervals".*

On one hand, Table E.1 confirms that many price effect estimates are
insignificant, and the authors' explanation as to the reason why the
estimates may have a large confidence interval seems compelling.[^4] On
the other hand, among the "Study Shares" estimates in Table E.1,[^5]
almost all the nine "Study Shares" effect estimates (three arms times
three goods sets: Overall, Agricultural, and Non-Agricultural items)
have a positive sign, three of them significant, and most with at least
around one standard deviation in the positive direction, and only one
with an economically meaningful negative price effect point estimate
(albeit only half a standard deviation in size). The table provides less
statistical information than some of the other tables (e.g. no
*p*-values for joint tests), so I could not follow in detail how exactly
the authors concluded \[that there were\] no significant price effects
in the data; overall, from the data provided, it was not what I
expected. In conclusion, from the table data, it should be noted at
least that economically highly positive price effect point estimates
were found, some of them individually significant and others often
roughly one standard deviation large.

Two further points with regards to the price effect seem worth keeping
in mind:

1\. Should the price effects indeed be economically significant, one
could imagine them to be mainly a temporary phenomenon. Many of the
goods surveyed (sandals, fertilizer, soap, ...) could arguably be
supplied to the market with constant or even increasing returns to
scale, once supply-chain and retail facilities adjust to the new demand
level.

2\. For a macroeconomically more significant UBI (nationwide or even
larger regions), demand-induced price increases could, (i) in a similar
'manna from heaven'-setup, be expected to be substantial rather
independently of whether \[...\] major price effects were found in the
present study. \[This is because\] demand effects for many of the
inter-regionally produced goods may only start to play a role once
quantities demanded increase on a country-wide basis. And (ii) in a more
typical UBI scheme, where regional taxes could be used to finance the
regional UBI, one could potentially expect there to be limited
first-order impact on average prices (as the taxes to be paid neutralize
the UBI payments received by households on average). \[...\] Again
\[this would be\] relatively independent of whether the prices in the
present study turn out to be meaningfully positive or not.

The authors refer to a forthcoming study apparently showing a tiny price
effect of cash transfers\[...\] I cannot meaningfully comment on
\[this\] without reading that study in detail; the results could
crucially depend on time and geographic dimensions of the treatment and
its measured effects.

**5. Claims on land value:** *Land values in treatment villages
increased strongly, without correspondingly large investments in the
enhancement of the value of the land.*

This claim appears to be well-supported by results from different
surveys, see Table 6. The interpretation \[makes intuitive sense\]: The
improved living conditions and/or the households' increased purchasing
power (and \[their\] search for ways to store wealth combined with
\[an\] inelastic supply of land) may have contributed to the land
appreciation \[...\]

**6. Claims on alcohol:** *There is evidence that alcohol problems have
decreased*.

This is factually true, although the evidence can be put into question
by potential biases in answers on particularly sensitive questions and
by harder, albeit statistically less significant, data pointing towards
a different interpretation:

The alcohol data is reported in Table E.10. Alcohol is perceived as a
large problem (baseline mean 3.37 on a scale of 1-5 of perception of
alcohol as a problem within the community). Alcohol as a problem in the
treated villages is reported to have decreased significantly, most
notably with a very substantial reduction of reported daily drinkers.
The point estimates on individual self-reports of drinking (columns 1
and 2) are all statistically insignificant and seem arbitrary in their
direction.[^6]

The authors do not discuss the last data column, about alcohol sales.
Coefficient point estimates point towards a very strong increase in
sales for each of the three UBI arms, two being significant at the 10%
level, with net revenues more than doubling on average across the three
treatment arms. The unit of the values is not indicated. On the one
hand, this evidence is statistically weaker than the villagers' reports
about alcohol in their villages. On the other hand, alcohol is a
particularly sensitive topic as the authors point out, so without
further evidence, it would certainly seem plausible that villager
reports about alcohol problems in their village are not perfectly
objective. This may be particularly true if very poor respondents know
they are surveyed to assess the effects on their village of a program
that provides for their livelihood.

It would therefore have been interesting to see whether the authors have
alternative explanations for the increased revenue figures to allow one
to understand whether the reservations about the overall conclusions on
alcohol here expressed may be safely dismissed or not.

## E. Further important limitations {#e-further-important-limitations}

*Caveats not addressed as part of the Main claims assessment above.*

Bias potential: 'Program goodwill' bias, survey completion rates,
alcohol results

-   Large parts of the study rely on self-reported data. This begs the
    question \[of the degree to which\] participants' answers may be
    biased by goodwill towards the program\[...\] \[This could be\] both
    due to positive views towards \[the program\], as well as
    potentially strategically in the hope, however faint, that positive
    answers could increase the probability of receiving future benefits
    from the program or from similar programs. There are two
    observations in the data presented that I interpret as underlining
    this hypothesis:

    -   The follow-up survey response rate (Table D.2) is significantly
        and substantially higher in each of the three arms than in the
        control, with roughly 1/3^rd^ less non-respondents in the arms
        than in the control.[^7] It would not seem *a priori*
        implausible that if the program motivates people to participate
        in the survey, they may also have some motivation to report
        positively about its effects. In a similar vein, estimated
        treatment effects could be affected if control households,
        informed about the treatment in nearby villages and knowing they
        were left out, answered surveys with biases of some sorts. On
        the one hand this is speculative -- the authors do not discuss
        the topic. On the other hand, at least intuitively, it would
        seem rather natural for such types of biases to arise in the
        given setting.

    -   Alcohol (Table E.10): Villager reports report a reduction of
        alcohol consumption problems in their villages (Columns 3-4). At
        the same time, point estimates indicate high increases in sales
        in all three arms (Column 5), although only significant at the
        10%-level in two of the three arms (see comment on alcohol
        above). Although statistical noise can obviously not be
        excluded, a preference for reporting a positive picture about
        the program's effects could immediately explain the observations
        in particular in this domain of the known large problem of
        alcohol.

Other NGOs

-   The authors report a significant effect on the number of other NGOs
    active in the treated villages, although it is not obvious (to me)
    how the corresponding data table is consistent with the author's
    exact text.[^8]

-   It would seem very useful to understand more about the activities of
    these other NGOs, and how the GD cash-transfer program affects their
    presence, to get a better understanding of how/whether study results
    may be driven by location-specific interaction effects that cannot
    be expected to generalize to different settings.

Information of participants/framing

-   The early-stage effects of a promised 12-year intervention may
    depend a lot on how much confidence participants have in the
    long-term nature of the project. This in turn depends on how the
    trial setup is framed/communicated. There is no information on such
    implementation details.

## F. Minor limitations {#f-minor-limitations}

-   Authors remove outliers (top percentile) in data without it being
    clear how this threshold was chosen.

-   Original datasets and code used do not seem to be made accessible.

## G. Final note on UBI {#g-final-note-on-ubi}

Extending and summarizing reasons for limited generalizability of
insights on the economic viability of typical UBI concepts, mostly due
to natural limitations of an exogenously financed cash-transfer RCT:

1.  Anticipated limited program duration (even of the longest arm).

2.  Limited lifetime exposure to the scheme (people not having grown
    up/socialized under a UBI scheme).

3.  Lack of public finance effects (requirement to absorb large domestic
    resources for UBI financing).

4.  Lack of macroeconomic scale (supply) effects when UBI is
    administered on a national or global scale.

5.  Further, with regards to generalizability to wealthier
    regions/higher UBIs[^9]: here \[this is\] a specific development
    context, with cash amounts not nearly sufficient to ensure what one
    might arguably consider a materially comfortable, healthy, and save
    life.

6.  Finally, with regards to a potential future with UBI and jobs
    AI-automated away, in the present study: lack of unavailability of
    meaningful remunerated jobs, along with, e.g., potential challenges
    to traditional sources of self-worth.

    report.

[^3]: When assuming 2 adults per 4.92 persons, where 4.92 is the average
    number of persons per household according to Table D.1. The payment
    per adult was 0.75 USD/day (1.88 USD/day PPP).

[^4]: the effects are from markets which may be surrounded by treated
    and untreated villages at the same time.

[^5]: The values provided in the "Numbers" columns in Table E.1 are less
    intelligible, as they estimate the effect of *one* single household
    on the log price level; a value that by definition must be close to
    zero so that the three digits the authors indicate cannot suffice to
    understand the effects. That said, they reflect the same almost only
    positive point estimates for the price effects of the UBI.

[^6]: While the authors write large effects are ruled out on these,
    judging from what is reported in the table (partly with too few
    decimals), the point estimates and the relatively large standard
    deviations mean, in relative terms, these effects do not appear to
    be obviously (much) smaller than some of the significant
    village-level values, and they could by themselves be going in
    either direction.

    the same table for the Fall 2019 survey and the Enterprise survey.

    \[..\], signiﬁcant in both ST and LS", though in Table E.3 it is the
    coefficient for LT (1% CI) and LS (10% CI) that are significant, and
    it is unclear to me why the (positive) values reported should
    signify a negative deviation from the control villages' numbers
    rather than a positive one. It would be useful if the authors could
    provide explain whether the reporting structure for this regression
    differs from that in other tables.

[^9]: Such a context might more plausibly lead (some) recipients to
    voluntarily give up wage work.
