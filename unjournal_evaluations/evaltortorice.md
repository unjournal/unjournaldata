## Written report

In "Advance Market Commitments: Insights from Theory and Experience."
Kremer, Levin and Snyder describe the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC)
mechanism that was used to increase coverage of Pneumococcal Conjugate
Vaccines (PCV) in low-income countries. This mechanism represents one of
the most important public health achievements of the recent past leading
to PCV coverage rates of around 50% in eligible countries compared to an
almost 0% coverage rate before the onset of the AMC. The authors
estimate the AMC saved 700,000 lives. This paper provides a convincing
argument for AMCs and a reasonable method for evaluating its effects. I
will highlight two areas where further research could be beneficial.

In evaluating the impact of the AMC, the authors assume that, absent the
AMC, PCV adoption would have followed the same path as Rotavirus vaccine
adoption in the same countries. While this is a reasonable baseline,
there are many reasons why that may not be the case. These vaccines are
produced by different manufacturers who may have different willingness
to supply vaccines to low-income countries. They also impact different
diseases and take-up may reflect the relative importance of treating
these diseases in low-income countries. Future research would be useful
in this area. Perhaps constructing a counterfactual using each
country\'s coverage of additional GAVI supported vaccines and using data
on PCV coverage in countries that are not eligible for the AMC could be
useful.

The theoretical portion of the paper provides a clear model of how the
AMC provides value. Additionally, it makes important points about the
cost of setting the subsidy too low and the potential costs of including
co-payments for eligible countries. In future work it would be valuable
to consider if the AMC is a permanent mechanism or one used to promote
the adoption of a vaccine. Since adoption of a vaccine usually
necessitates large annual expenditures indefinitely (as vaccines are
rarely removed from a national immunization program), it would be
helpful to know how to fund an AMC in perpetuity or how to transition
off the AMC. This point also relates to considering country co-financing
commitments as the hope with these is that countries will eventually be
able to finance these vaccines on their own. Therefore, the cost of
removing county co-financing requirements may be larger than the model
assumes. Relatedly, the model is a one-shot model, but, in reality,
there can be multiple bargaining periods and manufacturers may initially
reject offers but then accept higher offers in later periods. In this
case, risk of setting the price too low initially is less important.
Finally, in many of these cases, the manufactures are not strictly
profit maximizing but are constrained by social pressures to provide
vaccines at an affordable price. It would be useful to understand how
these pressures impact the ability of the manufacturer to bargain over
the vaccine price.
