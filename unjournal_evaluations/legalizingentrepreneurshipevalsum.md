# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Legalizing
Entrepreneurship"[@temp_id_9897630806278843]. To read these evaluations,
please see the links below.

# Evaluations

1.  [Anonymous Evaluation
    1](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/legalizingentrepreneurshipe1 "null")

2.  [Anonymous Evaluation
    2](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/legalizingentrepreneurshipe2 "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria.

**I. Overall assessment:**[^1]** **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in? (See
ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

This paper studies how entrepreneurship in Colombia was affected by a
nation wide policy that made almost half a million undocumented migrants
from Venezuela eligible for a residents visas (PEPProgram). The authors
find that having a visa increased the levels of entrepreneurship among
this population. As written in the evaluation \[...\] below, it has a
lot of strengths. The contributions are clear and are both empirical
(rarely studied outcome) and methodological (new empirical approach). In
the suggestions and minor suggestions section, some possible extensions
and critiques are specified).

## Anonymous evaluator 2

The study analyzes the effect of changes in migratory status on
entrepreneurship through a policy intervention that made Venezuelan
migrants in Colombia eligible for a resident visa. Causality is
established by using an extension of a regression discontinuity design.
The study found a positive effect on economic activity. However, it
might not be precise on the mechanisms that are driving the results (for
example, expanded access to credit, or subsidies?).

# Unjournal process notes

## Why we chose this paper

This paper was chosen because of its potential relevance in shaping
immigration policy in the context of Colombia, a country that has
recently implemented open policies amidst an international context
following the opposite path. In addition, the paper relies on a
methodological innovation that has the potential to help answer many
other causal questions.

### Further context

Suggester:

> The paper makes an emphatic claim that receipt of immigrants visa by
> Venezuelans in Colombia increases their economic activity in the form
> of higher entrepreneurship by a factor as high as 12. Since this
> finding can be the basis to argue for an increase in visa for
> immigrants in Colombia and elsewhere, the paper has high potential for
> policymaking and policy advocacy.

Second opinion:

> I don't think the specific context (S. America) involves the poorest
> people in the world, but I suspect much immigration and immigrant
> entrepreneurship *does* involve and affect the extreme poor, so I'm
> inclined to see it as very important for learning about this.

## How we chose the evaluators

We followed two criteria. The first one was to find applied economists
well versed in causal inference, in particular with research
discontinuity designs. The second one was to find people familiar with
the context, to be able to understand the various institutional and
cultural nuances of the policy. We were able to find two evaluators
fitting both criteria. One with deep expertise in RDD and the other with
deep expertise in the Colombian region. We find that both evaluators
fundamentally agree.

## Evaluation process

We shared the working paper with the evaluators and asked them to
evaluate the strength of the findings. After the evaluators sent their
reports, we asked them to revisit their evaluations for the focus of the
Unjournal, since their evaluations were closer to the standard
expectations in a "regular" peer-reviewed journal. In particular, we
asked for a more direct evaluation of the strength of the claims of the
paper. They both happily complied. Once the evaluations were completed,
we shared them with the authors of the paper and asked them to respond.
The authors were finishing their teaching, so they requested an
extension. Finally, they sent a response. Overall, the process took
around 3 months..

## On the added value of the evaluation

Both evaluators agreed on the strength of the evaluation and suggested
multiple ways to make the paper stronger, particularly in terms of
further exploring the mechanisms behind the effect.

These ideas may lead to increased external validity.

    to learn how this changed, and to see the earlier instructions.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: The topic is very relevant, given the increase in migration flows
    around the world. It is important to understand how to promote the
    socioeconomic integration of immigrants in host countries. The paper
    takes advantage of a policy intervention that increases our
    understanding of this matter.

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^8]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^9]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^10]: The paper is clear about the data sources (the Registro
    Adminsitrativo de Migrantes Venezolanos (RAMV) and the Registro
    Único Empresarial (RUES)), but given that these are administrative
    data, the authors should be clear about how it could be possible to
    request data access. For example, if there is a public entity that a
    researcher should contact.

[^11]: The methods are explained well enough and cite the original
    papers that implement the methodology. The data is not public, but
    it can be obtained by asking for permissions to the authorities in
    Colombia. They do not specify however, the procedure to obtain this
    data or who to contact, that would be useful for other authors.

[^12]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^13]: The paper contains real-world relevance and possible policy
    implications. However, it would be nice to provide a more empirical
    robust mechanism on the motives by which resident visa promotes
    economic activity in the form of higher entrepreneurship.

[^14]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?
