# Written report

## Brief explanation:

1.  The paper advances knowledge and practice on cash and psychotherapy
    interventions, testing long-term and spillover effects, replicating
    important earlier studies and specifying conditions for the cash
    transfer intervention further (lump-sum vs. dispersed/weekly
    transfers). It does not provide further insight on what would make
    the psychotherapy intervention work.

2.  Methods are generally robust and well-justified. 

3.  Logic and communication are clear, the reasoning is transparent,
    arguments make sense. Data and analysis are relevant to the
    arguments, and conclusions justified. Only when the authors conclude
    that the timing of the post-intervention measure is not a plausible
    explanation for why they don't find PM+, I disagree to some extent. 
    Figures and tables are easy to understand. 

4.  Open, collaborative, replicable science and methods: Methods and
    analyses are described in detail, but code and data is not shared,
    making computational reproducibility hard. Some, but not all
    materials are shared and can support future research.
    Pre-registration was done before analysis, not before data
    collection. Numbers are consistent throughout the paper.

5.  Real-world impact quantification: the paper tests a real-world
    intervention, and its results and conclusions are very plausible and
    realistic. 

6.  Global poverty and well-being is highly relevant to global
    priorities. 

## **Summary: **

The paper presents a pre-registered RCT in Kenya with the main goal of
comparing cash transfers to poor households with a psychotherapy
intervention called problem management plus (PM+), as well as testing
their combined effect. Primary outcome measures of the RCT included both
economic (consumption, assets, household revenue) and psychological
well-being (scales for psychiatric screening, stress, happiness, life
satisfaction scales, intimate partner violence). The cash transfer
corresponds to about 20 months of per capita consumption (in the control
group). PM+ is a five-week CBT-based program with one session per week,
in which a trained volunteer (community health worker) works on stress
management (e.g. relaxation and breathing exercises), problem-solving,
behavioral activation, and strengthening social support with individual
clients. 

This paper makes important contributions by testing earlier intervention
effects for their robustness, including additional outcomes, and
evaluating conditions under which the interventions work: (1) It adds
further evidence on the robustness of cash-transfer interventions having
effects on both economic and psychological outcomes. (A side finding is
that weekly cash transfers over 5 weeks are somewhat more effective in
increasing monthly non-durable consumption and revenue than one
lump-sum.) (2) It does not replicate spill-over effects of cash
transfers reported in Haushofer & Shapiro (2016), suggesting these are
not robust across different regions in Kenya. (3) It does not find
long-term effects of the PM+ intervention on **economic** well-being and
(4) and does not replicate effects of PM+ on **psychological**
well-being (previously reported for 3 months after this intervention)
with a more long-term (13 months) measure. (5) In line with this null
result, cash transfers combined with PM+ have a very similar effect on
most outcome variables than cash transfers alone. 

One earlier RCT (Bryant et al., 2017 [@temp_id_004985554398969416])
found effects on psychological well-being only (not on economic
outcomes) 3 months after the PM+ intervention in a sample of women who
were victims of intimate partner violence (IPV). The results on PM+
presented in the paper could indicate one of the following: that PM+
effects on psychological well-being...

1.  do not replicate. (This seems possible given the larger sample of
    this RCT.)

2.  do not replicate in a general sample, and are only successful when
    targeted at a specific problem (e.g. intimate partner violence in
    the earlier RCT).

3.  last for shorter than 200 days (from 200 days onward, analyses of
    effects over time show no impact on psychological or economic
    well-being). 

They also indicate that the current implementation of the PM+ was a lot
less cost-effective to increase both economic and psychological
well-being 1 year after the intervention than cash transfers. 

## **Other positive aspects and strengths**

-   First test of long-term effects of PM+, and of PM+ effects on
    economic well-being

-   Measures to reduce bias and questionable research practices: the
    analysis was pre-registered, this pre-analysis plan was largely
    followed, the paper corrects for multiple comparisons

    -   How the authors transparently report on a null result for a
        replication of spill-over effects of cash transfers, which they
        published themselves in an earlier paper (Haushofer &
        Shapiro, 2016) illustrates the limited influence of bias.

-   Robust methods, for instance, a larger sample than the earlier
    studies it replicates, with over 500 households per group, careful
    randomization procedure, different data quality checks and smart
    checks for demand effects.

-   Results are reasonable, and (almost) all conclusions justified (see
    limitations for one exception)

-   Clearly written

## **Limitations and potential ways the work could be improved:**

Below, I mention some small ways of improving the paper. I consider none
of them major limitations, but more refinements of the discussion of
some results, or small details that are missing in the paper. None of
what follows should change the main practical conclusion of the paper
that cash transfers are more cost-effective to improve economic and
psychological well-being in the long-term than the described
implementation of PM+, because PM+ had no such long-term effects. This
conclusion is solid in my opinion.

1.  **The discussion of explanations for why PM+ effects could not be
    replicated seems a bit too confident about the fact that the timing
    of the follow-up survey did not matter.** 

I think that the delay between intervention and follow-up could be a
potential explanation for why PM+ has no effects on psychological
well-being in the current study. The post-intervention survey was very
late to plausibly observe the effect of a short and low-intensity
psychotherapy intervention of maximum 5 sessions over 5 weeks. The
median time of the follow-up survey is 13.5 months (range: 2-23 months)
after the end of the intervention. First, from a psychological
perspective, the assumption that such a low-intensity,
individual-session therapy intervention would have a lasting effect over
a year later seems implausible. Second, the comparison of a cash
transfer intervention that corresponds to about 20 months of per capita
consumption (quite a long-term/intensive intervention), with a
low-intensity 5-week therapy intervention seems a bit unbalanced to me,
especially when evaluating outcomes after a year. I had the impression
that the study design was set up to measure cash transfer effects, and
then added PM+ into the design without adapting it to measure the
effects of this second intervention.\
\
I would suggest more clearly mentioning that the study was not set up to
detect effects at time scales shorter than 6.5 months (200 days) when
discussing the results. The claim that timing is unlikely to explain the
null-result could be phrased with more nuance, given that the current
analysis of effects over time can only speak to effects after 200 days.
Examples for changes I would make throughout the paper are: (1) after
the last sentence on p. 5 (" the delay between intervention and endline
is also unlikely to explain our null results ...") - include the
footnote number 6 into the main text. (2) change the statement "PM+
being ineffective" on p. 32 to be more specific and say "PM+ not having
any long-term effects".

Based on such discussions, future comparisons of other interventions
with psychotherapy could then choose interventions that are equally
plausible to have an effect (at the time scale measured), such as
higher-intensity or more long-term interventions, interventions in group
settings that could foster social support that lasts longer than the
intervention itself, or focus on more specific populations or problems.
Some of this is already discussed in the paper (e.g., in the final
conclusion).\
\
A note: Hindsight bias (thinking such an effect was implausible from the
start) could have influenced this judgement of mine; I assume the NGO
did believe the intervention could have a long-lasting effect at least
on psychological well-being after 1 year. I can also imagine that one of
the study's main goals was to show that such low-intensity psychotherapy
interventions are not effective compared to cash transfers in the
long-term, if such claims were made before. This is not obvious from how
the manuscript introduces its aims, however.

2.  **Some short/small clarifications on differences between the
    pre-analysis plan (PAP) and the paper plan would be important.**

-   One pre-registered sub-component of subjective well-being (the
    custom worries scale) was omitted in the paper, and not included in
    the index, without mentioning why.  This should definitely be
    mentioned as a deviation from the PAP in the paper. 

-   Some terms in the PAP differ from terms used in the paper, and it is
    unclear if they refer to the same variables. 

    1.  "Depression" (probably refers to the GHQ12, distress in the
        paper). Depression is mentioned as the main outcome variable in
        research question 1 in the PAP. Yet, later in the PAP and in the
        paper only the subjective well-being index and its subcomponents
        (not including depression) are described. If depression was
        simply not the correct term in the PAP, I would briefly mention
        this somewhere in the paper. 

    2.   "Mental health intervention for IPV": this sounds like an
        intervention targeted at a specific population and problem,
        rather than the general population PM+ intervention focused on
        many different kinds of problems described in the paper. I would
        clarify these terms briefly in the paper, for example as a
        footnote in the methods or in the Appendix. 

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Before reading the PAP in detail, I was wondering why no results on
    the analysis of norms around IPV were reported. The norm measure is
    briefly mentioned on p. 17, and all indices/questions are reported
    in the appendix, but no results are reported. The PAP clarifies that
    the norms analysis was only planned as part of the analyses of the
    mechanisms behind spill-over effects, which were not found and thus
    not analysed (see section III.J, p39).  I would recommend making
    that clear in the paper (on page 39/40).

3.  **Heterogeneity of results: Victims of IPV**

Since recruiting was not targeted at victims of intimate partner
violence (IPV), I wonder if a median split on IPV to examine
heterogeneity of results across women with and without IPV experience
actually includes enough study participants with such experiences to
rule out that PM+ has positive effects in this subsample. 

In parallel to the analyses conducted for participants with high
baseline distress, and extreme distress, an analysis among women with
IPV experience would be more convincing. If there are not enough such
women in the current study, I would more clearly entertain the
possibility that the intervention may only be helpful for this specific
population when discussing the heterogeneity of results with regard to
IPV on page 35 in section III.F. (The final conclusion does mention this
already).  

***Optional***

-   I would find a Figure like Figure 3 but for secondary outcomes very
    useful (e.g. in the Appendix). 

-   A note for Figure 1 that explains the abbreviations could be helpful
    (HH = households, what is BL and EL?).

-   Including a link to the other study mentioned on p. 11 on Digital
    Financial Service incentives would be useful, because both
    pre-registration and paper mention several questions/details related
    to it. 

-   Back-check reports (p 15): Calling participants to verify attendance
    of sessions 18 months after the intervention is very likely
    influenced by memory biases, that is, failures to recall all
    attended sessions. The statement "Our phone resurvey could not
    confirm the high rates of participants receiving the entire
    schedule, with only 35 percent (20 percent) of PM+ (CT&PM+) subjects
    remembering having received all five sessions" therefore seems to
    portray the data on attendance provided by the NGO in a more
    negative light than what seems justified. Self-reports after 18
    months are simply not a strong indicator for potential errors in the
    data. I would mention this to clarify what the back check results
    mean. 

-   I have some doubts about how warranted the request for future work
    taking the possibility that M+ might increase IPV seriously (p.28,
    end of 2nd paragraph) is. The results are much more suggestive of a
    demand effect, since the smiley and envelope tasks show no
    significant increase in IPV. Furthermore, the effects on IPV are not
    significant in the combined Cash and PM+ condition either. But I
    agree it's better to err on the side of caution, I would probably
    just rephrase the sentence so that it suggests that demand effects
    are the most likely explanation. 

-   It was not obvious to me why data collection was stopped during
    elections - because that might have influenced well-being? This
    could be mentioned very briefly. 

**Future research:** 

-   Could evaluating group-based approaches for PM+ or other
    psychotherapeutic interventions be important to increase
    cost-effectiveness and potential long-term effects? (If such
    research has not already been done since 2020).

-   Are there spill-over effects in the same household, i.e. for the
    family of the recipient of an intervention?

My references for these 2 questions: work by the [@nlqxazxx1ag]

therapy).
