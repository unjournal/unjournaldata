# Abstract 

1\. I do not see any major technical issues with the paper. \
2. The paper can be positioned more robustly i.e., the "need for it"
needs to be better argued. \
3. While the "effect" (mortality reduction) side of the paper has been
done well, the "cost" part of the paper could be deepened. This would
position it better and be supremely useful to policymakers.

# Written report

## Summary

A truly needed and useful paper. I commend the authors on what they have
produced.

The authors conduct a meta-analysis of mortality reduction from water
chlorination. They use a clear procedure to discover and include studies
into their analysis, restricting to randomized controlled trials for
ease of inference. They use both frequentist and Bayesian models to
derive odds-ratios (OR) for reductions in child mortality from a variety
of water chlorination programs. The find a \~24% reduction in mortality
from chlorination. This is a high-quality result with careful inclusion
of studies and an extensive sensitivity analysis. With this estimate in
hand, they conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of three water
chlorination interventions: chlorine dispensers in Western Kenya,
in-line chlorination in India and an MCH based delivery for a general
global context. They find that MCH delivery is the most cost-effective
while dispensers and in-line chlorination are relatively more costly,
though all three interventions are cost-effective compared to WHO
benchmarks.

The summary of my comments is:

1.  I do not see any major technical issues with the paper.

2.  The paper can be positioned more robustly i.e., the "need for it"
    needs to be better argued.

3.  While the "effect" (mortality reduction) side of the paper has been
    done well, the "cost" part of the paper could be deepened. This
    would position it better and be supremely useful to policymakers.

## Major Comments

I have two major comments.

### **1. Study framing**

My first comment has to do with positioning this study. Right now, it is
positioned as serving the need for evidence on the cost effectiveness of
water chlorination on reducing mortality. While I am personally very
partial to this and think it is worthwhile, I suggest that the authors
argue the premise more convincingly.

There is no doubt the quality of evidence in this paper is excellent. It
is a rigorous, high-quality update since the last such meta-analysis.
But it is one among many[^2] and I find it a little hard to believe that
policymakers---both globally, and at the national and local levels in
the health sector---are unconvinced that clean water is a top choice
when allocating their funds. Are policymakers still genuinely skeptical
about the cost-effectiveness of chlorination to reduce mortality,
especially child mortality, in a low-cost manner?

That many policymakers do not actually allocate as much as they "ought
to" is more the subject of a political economy analysis and not down to
irrational choices on their part. Just because they are not implementing
chlorination programs in a concerted, robust and enduring way does not
mean they do not accept the premise -- they are constrained in many
other ways which may prevent this. Clean water has been part of global
health policy focus for decades, everyone recognizes it as a high
priority investment area. So rationalizing it---yet again---is likely
not the issue holding back deployment of water treatment interventions.

Let's accept that there is little to no need to convince anyone that
water chlorination is absolutely the right thing to spend their money on
to prevent illness and death. Given this, I would urge the authors to
think a bit more about positioning this study.

One thought in this regard is that this study could be made more about
which water chlorination intervention is best suited for a given
context. In other words, going a bit beyond what this study is currently
doing. To explicate this, right now we have three interventions in three
unique contexts -- dispensers in Western Kenya, in-line chlorination in
India and an MCH based delivery for a general global context. What if I
was a Kenyan health policymaker and saw this study:

> I see that the MCH based chlorination is the most cost-effective. I
> think to myself maybe that is the first step I should take. But then I
> note that the estimate is for a generic global program, so now I am
> unsure. My MCH program is pretty robust and I know my costs probably
> fall on the lower end of the global distribution but I can't be sure.
> Maybe I should just take the Kenya specific result for dispensers and
> be done with it?

I have just played out a hypothetical here. The thing that happened
"well" is that a policymaker compared two possible ways to achieve a
child mortality outcome through water chlorination -- the primary
purpose of a CEA like this -- but what was weak in the above was that
MCH does not have a truly local, Kenya-specific cost-effectiveness
estimate that the policymaker could use, or no information that helps
them get close to it. And this is true for an Indian policymaker, and
other policymakers in lower-middle income and low-income countries. This
relates to my second major comment below i.e., a way to better position
this work

### **2. Deepen the cost modeling**

My second major comment has to do with the "cost" part of
cost-effectiveness: specifically, to deepen the cost analysis. I think
it is important to add some useful sophistication to the cost model,
while keeping it comprehensible. Being more thoughtful about cost
modeling and analysis has begun to take hold among policymakers and
donors.[^3] Deepening the cost part of this analysis offers one way for
the authors to better position this paper.

The first layer of sophistication that can be added is to build out a
cost model for each intervention which allows some variation. A full,
high effort version is to:

-   Build a cost model that explicates the key cost elements e.g.,
    materials, management, communications, transport and training, of a
    given intervention.[^4]

-   Then vary those elements -- much like a sensitivity analysis -- to
    get a variety of possible costs for the intervention.

-   Then, calculate a variety of cost-effectiveness estimates.

This enables a policymaker to "locate" their specific context in the
cost distribution for a given water chlorination intervention and look
up the relevant cost-effectiveness for it.[^5] A simpler way to generate
a range of costs might be to develop a low, middle and high cost for
dispensers, in-line and MCH then use those to derive a range of CEAs.
Policymakers, readers and anyone else interested in this, will be able
to locate their costs on the spectrum -- maybe a policymaker has good
information that---for dispensers let's say---their context is close to
the medium cost, therefore they will then use CEA estimates for the
medium cost scenario. Sohn et al (2020)[^6] show how you can think a bit
more deeply about modeling costs.

The second layer of sophistication is bounding/confidence intervals
which might allow a decision maker to see beyond just the "mean case"
and understand the extremes. For instance, in-line treatment might have
lower mean cost effectiveness but the "worst case" (upper bound on cost
per unit effect) for dispensers might be lower than that for in-line
which may drive a risk averse decision maker to pick dispensers for
their context. I do not have any great examples for you but you could
think along the lines of what Wakker and Klaasen (1995)[^7] suggest.

## Minor Comments[^8]

### **General**

-   ***Focus on CEA***: I appreciate that you want to acknowledge the
    broader benefits of these interventions i.e., your calculation of
    net benefits. I think this is kind of distracting to be honest.
    Focus on the CEA and make it about choosing the best water
    chlorination intervention variant that yields the lowest cost per
    reduction in child mortality.

    Relatedly, in your main manuscript, section "Cost-effectiveness",
    you do not state the cost per death averted (this was available in a
    previous version of the paper). I understand the switch to cost per
    DALY averted but the major thrust of your quantitative analysis is
    mortality. Are there strong reasons not to have that? Are
    comparisons not possible with cost per death averted? Is it possible
    to re-introduce this?

-   ***Timeframe for inclusion of studies:*** The publication dates of
    the studies used span a 23-year period, from 1998 to 2021; one can
    assume that actual implementation lagged publication. Page 17
    "Search strategy and selection criteria" says you used search
    criteria from past meta-analyses and updated to also include studies
    "...from February 2016 to May 2020". Looking at the search strings
    in Table S1, the search set titled "Limits", in which the search
    window seems to be 2012 to 2016, except for Ovid which is 2012 to
    "current". This is all a bit unclear.

    Can the authors:

    -   State in very clear terms what their full search window was?

    -   State why they chose this window, i.e., why start at a specific
        date (oldest you allow) and why end at a specific date (latest
        you allow)?

    The second of these questions also relates to the age of some of the
    studies included i.e., the oldest being over 23 years old. Is it
    alright to allow studies that are over two decades old in the
    analysis?[^9] Supplementary Materials\>4. Cost-effectiveness
    analysis\>Drivers of cost-effectiveness states that baseline
    mortality is a major driver of cost effectiveness. One would assume
    that over time, health outcomes are improving in LMICs and LICs
    i.e., bumping the baseline levels of mortality downward.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   ***Timeframes of studies:*** The studies have large variation in
    terms of follow up i.e., when outcomes of interest were measured
    (see unnumbered table at the end of Supplementary Materials\>1.
    Details of included studies and comparison with other RCTs). This is
    partly addressed by the authors in the sensitivity analysis by
    showing that studies with shorter timeframes are not driving
    results.

    However, this does raise the conceptual concern about what is meant
    by a water chlorination program in terms of timeframe, especially as
    it relates to the cost effectiveness. Currently, a five-year
    timeframe for implementation of the three representative
    interventions is used. That sounds reasonable but is there any
    reason (a) that we have the same horizon for all three (I can
    imagine something like in-line chlorination programming lasting
    longer than MCH or dispensers but I can imagine it the other way
    too) and (b) that we limit to thinking about a five-year horizon
    i.e., it may be that there is variation in cost-effectiveness based
    on differing time horizons (two, three, five, 10 and 15)?

    I think some language to explain why a five-year horizon was chosen
    would be good to have.

-   ***Study weights:*** For the weights provided in Table S4, we are
    not given a description for the weighting scheme used for the
    frequentist model but are for the Bayesian model (2. Meta-analysis
    models \> Study weights in Bayesian model). Possibly a non-issue,
    but just pointing this out. Any particular reason the weighting
    scheme for the frequentist model was not described?

## Specific

-   Fig. 1: Very much appreciate the clear articulation of search
    strategy.

-   Figure 2 (A) the OR for Luby et al. 2006 is very large (a previous
    version of the paper showed a smaller OR for this). Why is this? Is
    this something to be concerned about? In table S3, I see that Luby
    et al 2006 report 2 deaths in treatment compared to zero deaths in
    control -- this must be driving the large OR but surely there has to
    be some sensible way to constrain this rather than let it run away
    to a large number. Again, this is outside my technical expertise, so
    I defer to the authors. Just noting that anyone who reads this will
    see the strangely high OR for the Luby et al 2006 study in Fig. 2
    (A).

-   Sensitivity analysis: I appreciate very much the sensitivity
    analysis which reassures us on the quality of the results.

-   Footnote 7 in Supplementary Materials\>4. Cost-effectiveness
    analysis\> Drivers of cost-effectiveness is missing its text.

-   Table S7, footnote F, last line has a citation missing -- there's a
    note that says "....IPUMS \[add citation\]);...".

-   There's a jump from table S7 to Table S13 in the Supplementary
    Materials.

[^5]: You could also limit it to the geographies you already have, Kenya
    and India, since these are key geographies i.e., child mortality
    from something as basic as lack of clean water is most prevalent in
    sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and in South Asia. You could localize the
    cost model for dispensers and MCH delivery for India. And similarly,
    you could localize the MCH and in-line models for Kenya. You will
    need to model costs in a slightly more sophisticated way to match
    local conditions and make the cost-effectiveness estimates locally
    relevant.
