# Abstract [^1]

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Maternal cash transfers for
gender equity and child development: Experimental evidence from India\"
[@nqhb93bkd1k]. This trial involved moderate payments (about 10% of
average household consumption) directly to new mothers' and pregnant
women's bank accounts, along with light-touch messaging about nutrition.
The Unjournal prioritized this in part because of the importance of
understanding when *unconditional* transfers can help improve nutrition,
as monitoring *conditional *transfers is expensive.  The results were
mixed, with increases in caloric intake and gains in children's
functional development, but tightly bounded near-zero impacts on
children's heights and weights. Both evaluators --- experts in global
health and child development --- found a lot to like: "this is a timely
study that adds insight"; "strengths include scale, comprehensiveness,
and rigorous analysis of treatment effects and effect heterogeneity".
They also offered substantial critiques and suggestions. Evaluator 1 had
concerns about the use and reporting of the *Ages and Stages
Questionnaire*. They also wanted more policy-relevant interpretation of
the magnitudes, including "tangible and clinically meaningful
conclusions", a concern shared by the evaluation manager. The second
evaluator (Tsai) was puzzled by the "substantial gains in child
development even in the absence of impacts on anthropometrics or any
parenting/other behavioral 'plus' components", which contrasted with
related work. They asked for a better explanation of the context,
particularly concurrent *conditional *cash transfers (CCTs) and health
services targeting early childhood. They were skeptical of the
'nutrition only helped for the high-sanitation subgroup' claim, noting
that "other studies in LMICs have compared joint nutrition and
sanitation interventions to only nutrition interventions directly, and
effects on stunting, wasting, and underweight are not consistently
better." They also asked about the "exclusion of breastmilk from child
food consumption" accounting. To read these evaluations, please see the

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^2])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^3]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

This is a timely study that adds insight into whether and how
unconditional cash transfers to mothers can improve their health and the
health and development of their children in a low resource setting in
India. Major comments include the need to think through equitable
authorship, further describe certain aspects of the intervention (i.e.,
messaging provided to participants), and add detail to the methods
around the use of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire.

## Eleanor Tsai

Weaver et al. evaluate the first randomized trial of UCTs in India,
examining impacts on a battery of measures of household spending,
consumption, nutrition, and child growth and development. Strengths
include scale, comprehensiveness, and rigorous analysis of treatment
effects and effect heterogeneity. Critiques center around the
interpretation of results in light of (1) findings from previous studies
of cash transfers and integrated sanitation and nutrition interventions,
and (2) the context of concurrent CCTs and health services targeting
early childhood.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

*This was written by Sarah A. Reynolds. It is written directly
addressing the authors, but the discussion should be of interest to
other researchers and practitioners. *

 This study was chosen for evaluation because we recognize the
tremendous impact it can have on helping policy makers consider contexts
when implementing cash transfers and confirms that unconditional cash
transfers are also used for improving nutrition; conditionalities --
expensive to monitor -- are not always required.  

However, all of \[the\] authors are economists, and this paper has a
much broader scope for impact beyond a single field.  Thus, I have
solicited evaluations from two experts in global health and child
development. I find that they highlight some important ways in which you
can strengthen your paper and reach a broader audience.

Evaluator 1 starts with a call for including investigators from the
Global South.  Though many of you seem to be from the Global South or at
least those cultures, currently you are based in the US and have a
position of privilege.  Your work on the Global South shows your
commitment to your roots, for which I commend you, and your success in
your careers indicates that you are contributing to diversity locally. 
Thank you!  The suggestion to add additional investigators is not one
that need be done for this paper (since The Unjournal is not a
publication we do not have publication standards) but this is a growing
trend in international Public Health journals of which you should be
aware should you consider submitting for an audience broader than the
economics audience.  Perhaps you will bring this conversation into the
field of economics as well!

Evaluator 2 challenges you to compare your work in more depth to other
studies and speculate about why your findings are different from
others.  I understand that drawing conclusions from a small sample (# of
studies) is uncomfortable for economists. However, this will be very
useful to the readers to have your findings contextualized (which I
acknowledge you have done to an extent already).  This also leads nicely
into the comment from both evaluators that a section on limitations is
missing.  This is also typical of public health publications and a great
place to discuss the limited scope of the work, possible biases,
implementation challenges, data challenges, and suggest further research
that can build on your study.  This is the perfect place to state that
you have some thoughts about why your findings were different and more
study is needed.  A summary of the limitations in the discussion helps
others know you have fully thought them through and were unable to
address them for practical reasons.

Both evaluators also inquired if the ASQ \[Ages and Stages
Questionnaire, measuring child development milestones\] has been
validated in India or not.  As evaluator 1 pointed out, a cut-off for
below expected milestones would be very useful for helping your
interpretation.  Is this transfer "accelerating" child development or
bringing it in line with where it "should" be according to pre-existing
standards.  The comments on the usage of the ASQ scores as an outcome
are very valuable.  If you have not yet age-standardized scores, may I
suggest installing (via ssc) using the user-written (by me!) Stata
program stndzxage.  The included PDF tutorial illustrates why
standardizing by age is important.  Additionally, you may wish to divide
your standardization procedure into two age groups, with the cut-off
where the number of questions change.  And definitely consider how the
correlation of the subcategories of the ASQ impacts your findings in
that table.  You may consider decreasing p-value cut-offs to take into
account multiple hypothesis testing.

Both evaluators mentioned including flow charts: a consort diagram
(evaluator 1) and a DAG (evaluator 2).  While you may not use these in
your final paper, as you move your findings from academic publications
to those directly engaging with policy makers, these sorts of diagrams
can be useful to help the audience grasp your processes.

I agree with evaluator 2 that much more needs to be explored with
respect to the empowerment outcomes. You claim that this is a very large
amount of money -- do these empowerment findings align with what other
literature has explored?  Maybe they "should" be larger.  See Peterman
et. al.'s review on "Social Safety Nets, Women's Economic Achievements
and Agency: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"
<https://ideas.repec.org/p/cgd/wpaper/684.html>.  They likely have a new
version; you may wish to email the authors.  If you are seeking an
additional author from India, this would be a great area of the paper to
develop.  

The point about the impacts being clinically meaningful is important
(Evaluator 1).  Another option besides extrapolating to other outcomes
such as IQ, kindergarten readiness, or future earnings is to compare the
gains from this transfer to the gains from preschool or other child
development programs -- which is more cost effective with respect to
child development?  On the other hand, which is better for women's
empowerment?

[^2]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have
    encountered in the last three years." We requested they "consider
    all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge
    production, and importance to practice.

[^3]: See ranking tiers discussed
    [here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers).

[^4]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^5]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^6]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\
    \
    This was on the newer form only

[^7]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^8]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^9]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^10]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^11]: There is critical information about the intervention that would
    make it impossible to replicate the study. My score here reflects
    this opinion. As for replicating the analysis, I do think it would
    be possible.

[^12]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^13]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^14]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^15]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^16]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^17]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^18]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^19]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\
