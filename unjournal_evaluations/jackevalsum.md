[Money (Not) to Burn: Payments for Ecosystem Services to Reduce Crop
Residue Burning](https://seemajayachandran.com/money_not_to_burn.pdf)

# Preamble

**Paper: "**[Money (Not) to Burn: Payments for Ecosystem Services to
Reduce Crop Residue
Burning](https://seemajayachandran.com/money_not_to_burn.pdf)"

**Authors:** [B. Kelsey Jack](https://www.nber.org/people/kelsey_jack),
[Seema Jayachandran](https://www.nber.org/people/seema_jayachandran),
[Namrata Kala](https://www.nber.org/people/namrata_kala) and [Rohini
Pande](https://www.nber.org/people/rohini_pande)

We organized two evaluations of this paper. To read these evaluations,

# Evaluation Manager's Notes

## **Why we chose this paper**

This paper was recommended to us. Our reading of the paper was that it
seemed substantively important because it rigorously tested an
intervention that may be able to be competitive with GiveWell's top
charities, in addition to having environmental benefits. 

## **How we chose the evaluators**

We sought out quantitative social scientists that combined would provide
us with: expertise in the substantive subject area, expertise in the
methods used in the paper, and at least some familiarity with
cost-benefit analysis. We found two economists that covered this.

## **Evaluation process**

The process took about 3 months from start to finish. This is somewhat
slower than our target. Some of this was due to difficulties in finding
reviewers, and some of this was due to some parts of the process running
a little slower than expected.

As per The Unjournal's policy, the paper's authors were invited and
given two weeks to provide a public response to these evaluations before
we posted them. The authors elected not to have a public response, but
thanked the reviewers for their feedback.

## **Summary of evaluations**

The evaluations were both quite positive. One reviewer highlighted some
methodological details that could be improved, but both agreed that the
paper, in the words of one reviewer, "cleanly identifies an attractive
policy that solves a big problem."
