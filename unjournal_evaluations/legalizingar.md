In short, we suspect that starting a business takes some time.
Entrepreneurs must become familiar with their customers, potential
suppliers, or possibly identify real estate and/or other supplies. In
some cases, borrowing money could require a credit history with the bank

be necessary. For these reasons, immigrants establishing new businesses
would need time to set them up.
