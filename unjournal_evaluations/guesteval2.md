# Abstract 

This is an evaluation of "The Benefits and Costs of Guest Worker
Programs: Experimental Evidence from the India-UAE Migration
Corridor"[@temp_id_7966998928384137]. The evaluator summarizes this as
follows: The key contributions of this paper are its analysis of
intermediary costs of migration, migrant well-being and diversity in the
workplace, expectations of job-seekers and joint comparisons of various
pecuniary and non-pecuniary measures of migration. A major limitation is
the lack of a welfare justification for randomisation and little to no
discussion on equipoise. My suggestions largely revolve around
improvements to the discussion of methodology, representativeness,
attrition and representation of treatment effects.

# Written report

## **Summary**[^2]

In this paper, the authors describe their findings from a randomized
experiment on jobseekers in India. In particular, the paper studies
applicants to employment opportunities at two construction firms in the
UAE. Data is collected from approximately 4-5 thousand workers at
recruitment centers in six Indian states of a Singapore-based
recruitment firm. Five out of every seven candidates who successfully
clear the recruitment firm\'s selection process are randomly selected
and offered positions. Through a baseline survey, two tracking surveys,
one follow-up survey, and multiple alternative administrative data
sources, the authors observe and analyze the effects of being offered an
opportunity to migrate on several outcomes including actual migration,
labor market indicators, indicators of well-being, indicators of
work-satisfaction, religious and linguistic diversity in networks and
attitudes toward democracy, religious diversity, and inequality.

The primary findings of this paper are as follows:

1.  There is a high rate of non-compliance among workers who are offered
    positions, only 58% migrate to the UAE.

2.  Treatment groups experience significant increases in earnings and
    hours of work and significant decreases in physical well-being at
    the workplace. There are no significant effects on other dimensions
    of well-being.

3.  10% of gains from international migration are captured by
    intermediaries or migration agents.

4.  Among those who migrate to the UAE, prior expectations of earnings
    compare well to actual earnings.

5.  Treatment is also associated with increased exposure to individuals
    of different religions and linguistic groups and favorable
    attitudes.

6.  There is little noted heterogeneity in returns to migration, except
    for the group of workers who have experienced migration before.

7.  A theoretical model predicts that doubling of total offered
    compensation would induce full compliance among the non-complying
    workers (who are offered the job but do not migrate).

## **Evaluation**

### 1. Methodology

####  A. Ethics of migration {#a-ethics-of-migration}

Did the authors of this study randomly offer employment and migration
opportunities to some eligible candidates and consequently randomly
prevent employment and migration opportunities to other eligible
candidates? Or did the authors of this study exploit an existing
institutional randomization in the job market?

The authors make a rather weak argument for the latter, by describing
the randomization process as \"a natural extension of an existing system
in which firms request visas from the MOL and sometimes are granted all
of them and sometimes fewer than they request\" (Page 10). However,
footnote 21 clarifies that the two construction firms in question did
indeed have a guaranteed number of visas. This appears to be a
contradiction, in that in the absence of this study, presumably, the
workers would *not* have experienced any randomization through the visa
selection process. Footnote 21 further clarifies that the firms \"did
have to agree to screen more applicants than they usually would need to
for every position they wanted to fill\". Did the recruitment firms
increase the number of screened applications by inviting more
applications or by loosening their criteria for the screenings?

Without more information, it is difficult to assess the welfare costs of
this study on its participants. In its current form, it appears that in
the absence of this study, at least some of these control group
participants would have received an opportunity to be employed and
migrate to UAE and others in the treatment group may not have
successfully passed screening. Both these possibilities have important
implications, most importantly ethical implications but also empirical
implications (See 2A1). Furthermore, the authors do not mention any IRB,
nor do they describe the ethical oversight or involvement of local and
other stakeholders.

Knowing what is shared in the paper in the form of previous literature
on the returns to migration, it is hard to believe that authors did not
have any priors about the welfare implications of employment and
migration on study participants, and if that is the case, how do they
justify equipoise? Taking this argument further, it is also likely that
authors might have had credible priors on which groups of participants
benefit most from employment/migration based on the baseline survey.

#### B. On selection and representativeness {#b-on-selection-and-representativeness}

-   The literature review discusses the contribution of this paper as
    better understanding selection into migration. This deserves further
    qualification: the paper is able to qualitatively describe general
    selection into migration, but the empirical contribution is rather
    addressing the selection into migration conditional on applying for
    an international job, i.e. conditional on having intent to migrate.

-   The experimental design mentions that the recruitment sites are a
    sample. If so, how were recruitment sites selected? How many
    recruitment sites do the partner firms have? Do they only recruit
    from the 6 listed states? The recruitment sites are mentioned as
    being close to construction training schools. Are workers mostly
    fresh graduates of these schools?

-   One issue of selection and/or representativeness that the paper does
    not tackle is whether the 6 states are representative of migrant
    workers from India to the UAE (in construction or general). It is
    well known that southern Indian states, particularly Kerala, have
    historically contributed most in numbers toward migration to UAE.
    The paper would benefit from further comments and comparisons on
    this front, potentially using data from the Kerala Migration
    Surveys.

-   The exclusion of southern states also has an implication for the
    analysis of friendship and linguistic and religious exposure.
    Specifically, given the historic pattern of migration from south
    India to UAE, it is likely that Indian migrants from historically
    non-contributing states are more likely to have increased exposure
    to new linguistic and religious groups through migration than others
    from historically contributing states. This paper has an empirical
    advantage on this front, and this deserves some discussion.

-   At the same time, one potential disadvantage of this exclusion of
    southern states is that it limits the generalizability of the
    analysis of marginal treatment effects, especially if the authors
    expect that heterogeneity (either in baseline characteristics or in
    returns) \[will\] be more pronounced among historical migrant
    groups. Just as how authors discuss that estimates may be a lower
    bound on the non-pecuniary costs (Page 41), because the sample is
    drawn from candidate interviewees, it would be helpful to discuss
    similar implications because of sample states.

-   For similar reasons, it would be useful to discuss state-based
    heterogeneity in the analysis of heterogeneous returns.

### 2. Empirics

#### A. Always takers and Never takers {#a-always-takers-and-never-takers}

A more detailed description of never-takers and always-takers which
would help contextualize the ITT results better;

-   On never-takers, what is the historical percentage of applicants to
    refuse to take up the offer? Given that the authors mention that the
    recruitment firms screened more candidates for the purposes of this
    study, is it possible that the percentage of never-takers is more
    than usual?

-   On always-takers, is it the case that applicants that visited the
    survey recruitment centers also visited other recruitment centers
    during this recruitment period? What are the channels by which the
    applicants who failed the screening entered the UAE job market? Were
    they recruited by similar recruitment companies? Did they end up
    working for similar firms?

#### B. Attrition {#b-attrition}

An important part of this paper is how authors deal with attrition.
Attrition is impressively contained and \[this\] is testament to what
must have been painstaking work for the research assistants and authors.

In describing the observed attrition, authors could include more
details. For example, what are the dimensions in which there is
imbalance? While this is self-evident in Appendix Table A.1., this
information should also be discussed on Page 16. Is there any proposed
explanation for the observed selection into attrition? Another
discussion worth having is whether attrition is observed differently for
the treatment and control group, as the authors seem to assume this in
bounding their results in Section 4.4. If so, what is the difference,
and what are the authors\' priors on how this would bias the results? A
qualitative discussion of this would help \[convince readers\] about the
usefulness of the bounding exercise carried out later in the paper.

#### C. Treatment effects {#c-treatment-effects}

-   It is unclear why authors do not control for baseline wealth (as
    measured by net assets) in the specifications, given that there is
    imbalance in this dimension between the treatment and control group.
    Do other fixed effects take care of this? What is the implication of
    this baseline difference on the follow-up finding of no significant
    differences in net assets between the treatment and control group
    (Table 7)?

-   While most treatment effects reported in the paper are
    conservatively ITT, and authors do share with us the scaling factor
    for TOT earlier in the paper, it would be useful to also have a
    TOT/IV represented in the main results tables, especially in the
    context of the impact on well-being and work satisfaction.

-   Is it possible that workers who have received offers have fairly
    accurate expectations of their earnings because the partner
    firms/recruitment firms have communicated this information well? If
    so, is this an unusual characteristic of the employer firm?

-   Is the no-offer density of well-being bimodal in Figure 4. because
    of the sub-group within the control group that did migrate to the
    UAE?

### 3. Policy Implications

In addition to the national policies mentioned on Page 9, it would be
good to learn about ... state policies and bilateral agreements with the
UAE \[if there are any\]. What are the specific rules and regulations
governing migration from the 2022 MOU that have little enforcement? This
is especially important to \[help us\] understand whether there is a
current policy audience for the findings of this paper.

### 4. Editorial Comments

-   Recommend not using the terminology \"lower caste\".

-   Recommend moving Appendix A2 to main text.

-   On page 10, it would be helpful to clarify whether offered wages
    have little variation within the firm or across the two surveyed
    firms?

-   On Page 24, the authors mention that \"They are earning less in
    India than they expected to earn if they migrated, consistent with
    the idea that they only migrate for higher earnings.\" This claim is
    more credible without the use of the word \"only\".

-   The term \"Indian men\" is often used to refer to the sample, but it
    would be more accurate to say, \"male construction workers from
    north India\".

-   Figure 5 legends mention \"Less\" of certain indicators, which is
    unnecessary and confusing as it appears as a double negative (for
    example, negative coefficient on less Fighting).

-   On Page 41, perhaps it should be given the lack of heterogeneity *in
    returns* on observables.

-   Calculations in Section 4.8 is the most interesting contribution of
    this paper, and it would be helpful to have more subsections in this
    section, delineating the model, estimates from literature,
    assumptions/calibrations made and final calculation.

-   On Page 22, the uthors mention that this study provides evidence
    against the idea that migrant workers in the GCC are forced to work
    excessive hours. However, in footnote 15, the authors describe that,
    in this context, the two firms that they are partnered with are
    large firms that are more likely to follow labor regulations.
    Perhaps they can qualify this statement more.

-   In page 3, the authors describe that never-takers have somewhat
    lower UAE earnings. They should clarify that these are calculated
    potential outcomes (given that it is only shortly before that the
    authors define never-takers as those who do not migrate).
