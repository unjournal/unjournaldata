# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Willful Ignorance and Moral
Behavior". To read these evaluations, please see the links below.

## **Evaluations**

1\. [Joshua
Tasoff](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/eval1moralbhvr "null")

2\. [Romain
Espinosa](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/eval2moralbhvr "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^1]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").)
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summaries

## Joshua Tasoff

The paper is professionally written and the experiment is well-designed.
The main result, avoiders of a VR animal advocacy message exhibit larger
treatment effects on consumption than information seekers, is novel and
important. I find the claims about the dynamics of the treatment effect
to be less supported by the evidence. It is more speculative.

## Romain Espinosa

This study is an outstanding work that will become a major reference in
the empirical literature about information avoidance and meat
consumption. First, the authors make here a highly valuable contribution
to the economic discipline and, in particular, to the research on
dietary transitions by determining the causal impact of information
provision on individuals conditional on their a priori willingness to
get informed. This is an important research point both for economics in
general (where the question of information avoidance has been discussed
intensively over the past five years) and for dietary transitions, where
researchers and society struggle to induce dietary changes (changes
which are needed in light of the environmental, health, and ethical
issues arising from large scale meat consumption in developed
countries). Second, the authors came up with a lab & field design with
real consumption choices, which has been relatively rare in the
empirical literature on dietary changes. Following individuals outside
of the lab is a key element \[for considering\] issues like displacement
or long-term effects. In addition, looking at effective dietary choices
is central, as the attitude-behavior gap in nutrition is a major
limiting factor for this research literature. Here, the authors also
show that the effect of watching the video on effective consumption
choices is short-lived. Third, on the estimation side, the authors
propose a neat empirical strategy to elicit the conditional impact
(addressing the issue of self-selection), discuss the potential problems
at length (e.g., displacement of meat consumption), clearly expose the
deviations from their pre-analysis plan, and carefully thought about
numerous design issues (e.g., the alternative video). Overall, I am very
supportive of this work.

## Why we prioritized this work

Animal welfare advocates argue that consumption of animal products
through factory farming leads to massive suffering, and reducing this
consumption could substantially reduce this. A range of interventions
aimed at influencing individual behavior have been considered, but there
is very limited evidence on whether these are successful. Indeed,
effective altruism linked animal welfare advocates have moved away from
this approach in favor of corporate campaigns.

However, this may be from a lack of evidence rather than evidence that
these interventions are ineffective.  Of course, there may be
heterogeneity; these interventions may be more effective for some
audiences than others. It may matter whether these initiatives and ads
are targeted towards 'seekers', neutral people, or even potential
'avoiders'. E.g., we could compare 'push' vs 'pull' marketing, ads
targeted towards those showing interest in animals versus more neutral
or 'surprise' ads etc.

The authors' work seems to have several rare and valuable strengths:

-   a credible strategy for differentiating the effects of such
    information/stimuli on avoiders versus seekers, in a way that seems
    robust to differential selection issues.  

-   incentivized choices (of food vouchers)

-   more consequential *field* evidence (linked to the lab experiment
    treatments?), with perhaps less potential for demand effects,
    temporary agreeability bias, etc.

In a general sense, The Unjournal is seeking to stimulate more rigorous
social science research relevant to animal welfare, including a focus on
consumption attitudes.  This is one of our first forays in this
direction.

## What we asked evaluators to consider

We shared the manager's notes linked
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P1WZ_r_mOEqHc01P2R2BNhj5AF6KzIBnqDdJ8V6a698/edit?usp=sharing "null").
Excerpting:

> Consistent with The Unjournal's stated mission, and approach... We are
>  interested in the specific applied and empirical questions, and in
> the implications of this for animal welfare marketing interventions,
> and interventions in adjacent areas.

These notes presented a range of fairly specific suggestions for
evaluators to consider, as well as Nicolas Treich's previous notes for
the authors. \

## Evaluation process

The authors were aware of this process and happy to have us give
feedback on their work, sharing the most recent version of the paper.

## Conflict of interest considerations 

One of the evaluators is a member of The Unjournal's broad team.
However, they did not play a decisive role in prioritizing this paper
for evaluation.

    to learn how this changed, and to see the earlier instructions.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^6]: I think this is more of a basic science paper combined with
    treatment effects on what particular intervention.

[^7]: This work is very informative about the challenges that empirical
    research on dietary changes faces. It combines several strengths
    that are seldom jointly present in other empirical works: revealed
    preferences, lab and field data, and randomization at the individual
    level. The results will help NGOs and policymakers in
    supporting/stimulating dietary transitions and will benefit the
    scientific community (positive relationship between information
    avoidance and information elasticity).

[^8]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^9]: The methods seem reasonable. I\'m not an expert on econometrics
    and the IPW estimator so I was unable to assess this.

[^10]: The experimental design is very well done and clearly exposed.
    The empirical methods are sound and the authors present convincing
    evidence about the most immediate robustness concerns.

    \

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: The paper is written clearly and all arguments are well
    presented.

[^13]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^14]: I have not seen any link to the data and codes. I assume that the
    data are too sensitive to be shared (individual-level consumption
    data with identifiers). So, this category would not be applicable.
    (So, I indicated 50.)

[^15]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^16]: Very relevant as such videos are widely spread and viewed in
    society. The only departure from reality might be the 360°
    dimension.

[^17]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^18]: The topic of the paper (industrial animal farming) is one of the
    greatest challenges our societies currently face. Congratulations to
    the authors for addressing such an important topic.

[^19]: Unfortunately, it is not yet clear whether animal-welfare
    economics has enough buy-in from the profession to be considered a
    subject of interest. I think there is a greater than average risk
    that the paper would be under-placed.

[^20]: I fear that some editors in top economic journals are still
    reluctant to publish works related to animal welfare. So, I think
    there is a risk of this paper being underpublished.
