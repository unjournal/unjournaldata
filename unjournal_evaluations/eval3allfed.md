## Written Report

I am a political scientist specializing in science policy (i.e., how
expertise and knowledge production  influences the policymaking process
and vice-versa), with a focus on "decision making under conditions of
uncertainty," R&D prioritization, and the governance of systemic and
catastrophic risk. With respect to the various categories of expertise
highlighted by the authors, I can reasonably be considered a "policy
analyst."

Potential conflict of interest/source of bias: one of the authors (Dr.
Anders Sandberg) is a friend and former colleague. He was a member of my
PhD dissertation committee. 

A quick further note on the potential conflict of interest/bias of the
authors (three of the four are associated with ALLFED, which, as the
authors note, could stand to benefit financially from the main
implication of their analysis - that significant funding be allocated to
resilient food research in the short-term). In my opinion, this type of
"self-advocacy" is commonplace and, to some extent, unavoidable.
Interest and curiosity (and by extension, expertise) on a particular
topic motivates deep analysis of that topic. It's unlikely that this
kind of deep analysis (which may or may not yield these sorts of
"self-confirming" conclusions/recommendations) would ever be carried out
by individuals who are not experts on - and often financially implicated
in - the topic. I think their flagging of the potential conflict of
interest at the end of the paper is sufficient - and exercises like this
Unjournal review further increase transparency and invite critical
examinations of their findings and "positionality."

I am unqualified to provide a meaningful evaluation of several of the
issues "flagged" by the authors and editorial team, including: the
integration of the sub-models, sensitivity analysis, and alternative
approaches to the structure of their Monte Carlo analysis. Therefore, I
will focus on several other dimensions of the paper.

#### Context and contribution

This paper has two core goals: (1) to explore the value and limitations
of relative long-term cost effectiveness analysis as a prioritization
tool for disaster risk mitigation measures in order to improve decision
making and (2) to use this prioritization tool to determine if resilient
foods are more cost effective than AGI safety (which would make
resilient food the highest priority area of GCR/X-risk mitigation
research). As I am not qualified to directly weigh in on the extent to
which the authors' achieved either goal, I will reflect on the
"worthiness" of this goal within the broader context of work going on in
the fields of X-risk/GCR, long-termism, science policy, and public
policy - and the extent to which the authors' findings are effectively
communicated to these audiences. 

Within this broader context, I believe that these are indeed worthy (and
urgent) objectives. The effective prioritization of scarce resources to
the myriad potential R&D projects that could (1) reduce key
uncertainties, (2) improve political decision-making, and (3) provide
solutions that decrease the impact and/or likelihood of
civilization-ending risk events is a massive and urgent research
challenge. Governments and granting agencies are desperate for rigorous,
evidence-based guidance on how to allocate finite funding across
candidate projects. Such prioritization is impeded by uncertainty about
the potential benefits of various R&D activities (partially resulting
from uncertainty about the likelihood and magnitude of the risk event
itself - but also from uncertainty about the potential
uncertainty-reducing and harm/likelihood-reducing "power" of the R&D).
Therefore, the authors' cost-effectiveness model, which attempts to
decrease uncertainty about the potential uncertainty-reducing and
harm/likelihood-reducing "power" of resilient food R&D and compare it to
R&D on AGI safety, is an important contribution. It combines and applies
a number of existing analytical tools in a novel way and proposes a tool
for quantifying the relative value of (deeply uncertain) R&D projects
competing for scarce resources.

Overall, the authors are cautious and vigilant in qualifying their
claims - which is essential when conducting analysis that relies on the
quasi-quantiative aggregation of the (inter)subjective beliefs of
experts and combines several models (each with their own assumptions). 

#### Theoretical/epistemic uncertainty

I largely agree with the authors' dismissal of theoretical/epistemic
uncertainty (not that they dismiss its importance or relevance - simply
that they believe there is essentially nothing that can be done about it
in their analysis). Their suggestion that "results should be interpreted
in an epistemically reserved manner" (essentially a plea for
intellectual humility) should be a footnote in every scholarly
publication - particularly those addressing the far future, X-risk, and
value estimations of R&D. 

However, the authors could have bolstered this section of the paper by
identifying some potential sources of epistemic uncertainty and
suggesting some pathways for further research that might reduce it. I
recognize that they are both referring to acknowledged epistemic
uncertainties - which may or may not be reducible - as well as unknown
epistemic uncertainties (i.e., ignorance - or what they refer to as
"cluelessness"). It would have been useful to see a brief discussion of
some of these acknowledged epistemic uncertainties (e.g., the impact of
resilient foods on public health, immunology, and disease resistance) to
emphasize that *some* epistemic uncertainty could be reduced by exactly
the kind of resilient food R&D they are advocating for.             

#### Presentation of model outputs

When effectively communicating uncertainties associated with research
findings to multiple audiences, there is a fundamental tradeoff between
the rigour demanded by other experts and the digestibility/usability
demanded by decision makers and lay audiences. For example, this
tradeoff has been well-documented in the literature on the IPCC's
uncertainty communication framework (e.g., [@temp_id_8152545184988127]).
What fellow-modelers/analysts want/need is usually different from what
policymakers want/need. The way that model outputs are communicated in
this article (e.g. 84% confidence that the 100 millionth dollar is more
cost-effective) leans towards rigour and away from
digestibility/usability. A typical policymaker who is unfamiliar with
the modeling tools used in this analysis may assume that an 84%
probability value was derived from historical frequencies/trials in some
sort of experiment - or that it simply reflects an intersubjective
assessment of the evidence by the authors of the article. Since the
actual story for how this value was calculated is rather complex (it
emerges from a model derived from the aggregation of the outputs of two
sub-models, which both aggregate various types of expert opinions and
other forms of data) - it might be more useful to communicate the final
output qualitatively. 

This strategy has been used by the IPCC to varying levels of success.
These qualitative uncertainty terms can align with probability
intervals. For example, 80-90% confidence could be communicated as "high
confidence" or "very confident." \>90% could be communicated as
"extremely confident." There are all sorts of interpretation issues
associated with qualitative uncertainty scales - and some scales are
certainly more effective than others (again, see
[@temp_id_8152545184988127]) but it is often useful to communicate
findings in two "parallel tracks" - one for experts and one for a more
lay/policy-focused audience.

#### Placing the article's findings within the broader context of global priorities and resource allocation

Recognizing the hard constraints of word counts - and that a broader
discussion of global priorities and resource allocation was likely "out
of scope" - this article could be strengthened (or perhaps simply
expanded upon in future work) by such a discussion. The critical piece
of context is the scarcity of resources and attention within the
institutions making funding decisions about civilization-saving R&D
(governments, granting organizations, private foundations, etc.). There
are two dimensions worth discussing here. First, R&D activities
addressing risks that are generally considered
low-probability/high-impact with relatively long timelines (although I
don't think the collapse of global agricultural would qualify as
low-risk - nor is the likely timeline terribly long - but those are my
priors) are competing for scarce funding/attention against R&D
activities addressing lower-impact risks believed to be shorter-term and
more probable (e.g., climate change, the next pandemic, etc.). I think
most risk analysts - even hardcore "long-termists" - would agree that an
ideal "R&D funding portfolio" be somewhat diversified across these
categories of risk. It is important to acknowledge the complexity
associated with resource allocation - not just between X-risks but
between X-risks and other risks. 

Second, there is the issue of resource scarcity itself. On the one hand,
there are many "high value" candidate R&D projects addressing various
risks that societies can invest in - but only a finite amount of funding
and attention to allocate between them. So, these organizations must
make triage decisions based on some criteria. On the other hand, there
are also a lot of "low" or even "negative value" R&D activities being
funded by these organizations - in addition to other poor investments -
that are providing little social benefit or are actively increasing the
likelihood/magnitude of various risks. I believe that it is important in
these sort of discussions about R&D prioritization and resource scarcity
to point out that the *reosource pool need not be this shallow* - and to
identify some of the most egregious funding inefficiencies (e.g., around
fossil fuel infrastructure expansion). It should go without saying---
but ideally, we could properly resource both resilient food and AGI
safety research.\
