# Abstract 

If I were reviewing this manuscript for an economics journal, I would
recommend revise and resubmit, with only minor revisions. Overall, the
manuscript is well written in the sense that, since the reader
understands immediately what is being estimated and why, that they could
be lulled into the trap of thinking that the research is "obvious." The
final line before the conclusion is \"We conclude that climate change
poses a substantial threat to the world economy.\" But it is the careful
empirical construction of the argument, and the identification that a
literature has been mechanically missing (netting out) the effect of
global temperature shocks while focussing exclusively on local
temperature shocks, that gives this manuscript its evident worth. The
manuscript consists of two parts. First, a reduced form impact of global
temperature shocks on economic activity at the world and country level.
Second, a structural model to convert those estimates into welfare
losses and a valuation of the social cost of carbon. The first is the
"heart" of the paper in my estimation, while the second half is where
many articles stop short - the "so what."

## \[Overview and discussion of strengths and implications\]

This is a reviewer report for \"The Macroeconomic Impact of Climate
Change: Global vs. Local Temperature.\" The version reviewed is labelled
November 2024. If I were reviewing this manuscript for an economics
journal, I would recommend revise and resubmit, with only minor
revisions.

The manuscript\'s main claim is that macroeconomic damages from climate
change are six times larger than previously thought (around 12% instead
of 2% reduction in world GDP following 1 degree Celsius of warming).
This is because previous work does not account for (or indeed misses the
effect of) global shifts in warming. The effect of global (rather than
local) warming is proposed to occur through many mechanisms (considered
via the top-down rather than bottom-up analysis), while the *warming
increases extreme climate events* mechanism is specifically evidenced. A
suite of robustness checks, at all stages of the comprehensive analysis,
assuage many of the concerns the applied economics reader may have.

These previously underestimated damages, when used to inform a standard
neoclassical growth model, paint policy makers a dire portrait. The 2024
world GDP is around 20% lower than it would have been absent the already
observed warming. Further, 2040\'s GDP will be an estimated 25% lower
than it would have been under business-as-usual projections. The related
Social Cost of Carbon, which is often used as a benchmarking for whether
an emissions-reducing policy is "worth it" is \$1,367 per ton of abated
CO2. This is striking when compared to the fact that most
decarbonization policies cost around \$80 per ton.

Overall, the manuscript is well written in the sense that, since the
reader understands immediately what is being estimated and why, \[...\]
they could be lulled into the trap of thinking that the research is
"obvious." The final line before the conclusion is \"We conclude that
climate change poses a substantial threat to the world economy.\" But it
is the careful empirical construction of the argument, and the
identification that a literature has been mechanically missing (netting
out) the effect of global temperature shocks while focussing exclusively
on local temperature shocks, that gives this manuscript its evident
worth.

The manuscript consists of two parts. First, a reduced form impact of
global temperature shocks on economic activity at the world and country
level. Second, a structural model to convert those estimates into
welfare losses and a valuation of the social cost of carbon. The first
is the \"heart\" of the paper in my estimation, while the second half is
where many articles stop short - the "so what."

In my estimation, the result - that global temperature shocks have large
and persistent negative effects on GDP - has the potential to reframe a
literature that began with Dell, Jones, and Olken (2012)[@n6wwyykhpel].
I hope that this work has the same effect as Goodman-Bacon for the DID
literature.[^4] Empirically, it reads as the inevitable next step of the
climate change - temperature - extreme event - GDP literature.

The manuscript contains numerous robustness tests, including \[some...\]
involving much work (such as re-estimation with a temperature measure
independently created than the primary one), and clear explanations
about why each was implemented.

The data and methods used in the estimation of warming damages are
state-of-the-art and conducted in a clear and reasonable manner. The use
of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Database is compared against
using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, to little
difference. Literature standard data are taken from ISIMIP, the Penn
World Tables, and Jordà-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory database. The
methods used are approachable and appropriate - and robust to
alternative research choices such as, when appropriate, not using the
Hamilton projections.

## \[Requests to authors\]

In section 5.2, at the moment the range for the SCC \[social cost of
carbon\] which is reported are the 95% confidence intervals. However,
policy makers often focus on just one number, and may choose to focus on
the lower bound if they are sceptical about climate change impacts. From
an application perspective, therefore, it might be better to focus on a
different, but equally conventional, bound: the 90% confidence interval.
Naturally, the 90% range will be narrower --possibly by quite a bit if
the tails are relatively thin -- and it will ensure that the (reported)
lower bound of the SCC is higher. This is a taste-based, and normative
comment, with a view to how this crucial work may be applied

My primary request of the authors is to provide a comparison between
\[...\] business-as-usual and the other pathways ahead. Give us, the
readers, a section which tells us just "how bad" things can be, yes, but
also under different IAM\'s \[Integrated Assessment Models, presumably\]
and pathways, such as in Burke, Hsiang, Miguel (2015)[@nyue6976spx]
Figure 5.

My secondary request is to increase the lags applied throughout (but
most specifically in section 2.2) to at least 7 (the appendix goes to 4)
given the cited geo-physical literature noting cyclicality of solar
cycles being as long or longer.

A taste request is to characterize - up front - just how out-of-sample a
1C change truly is. The largest \[change\] in the sample is 0.3C.
Calibrating response damages to this largest, but not particularly
uncommon, shock might add to the credibility of the paper rather than
take away from its message.
