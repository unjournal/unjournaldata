# Abstract[^1]

This paper studies how entrepreneurship in Colombia was affected by a
nationwide policy that made almost half a million undocumented migrants
from Venezuela eligible for resident's visas (PEPProgram). The authors
find that having a visa increased the levels of entrepreneurship among
this population. As written in the evaluation \[content\] below, it has
a lot of strengths. The contributions are clear and are both empirical
(rarely studied outcome) and methodological (new empirical approach). In
the "suggestions and minor suggestions" section, some possible
extensions and \[critiques\] are specified.

# Written report[^3]

## First Impressions

This paper studies how entrepreneurship in Colombia was affected by a
nationwide policy that made almost half a million undocumented migrants
from Venezuela eligible for resident visas (PEP Program).

The authors find that having a visa increased the levels of
entrepreneurship among this population.

## Strengths

It is an amazing paper to read. Very well written, especially since the
context of the policy is key for understanding the logic of the
methodology used.

Its contributions are both empirical and methodological. In the
empirical part, it studies entrepreneurship, an outcome that has not
been studied much in the literature of gains from legalizing migration.
The methodological contribution is the application of the new methods
that study how to get casual estimates when there is a nonrandom
exposure to an exogenous shock. They translate these methods to the
context of a regression discontinuity design and propose an instrument
for differences between the predicted and actual realizations of the
running variable. This is one of the most novel parts of the article.

Apart from the proposed methodology and its instrument, it also uses a
regular panel method which provides similar results for the main
specification.

## Suggestions

I find it hard to make comments criticizing this paper, however, some
ideas have come to mind that might be useful to think about them, either
as a robustness check or a possible extension.

1.  The article finds "similar impacts on the creation of both employer
    and non-employer firms." While these employer firms create 1 to 6
    new jobs and are not 'high growth' by the typical standards of
    developed countries, they still represent meaningful economic
    spillovers." I wonder if it would be possible to try to study some
    of these economic spillovers. For example, using employer-employee
    matched data from the "Planilla Integrada de Liquidación de Aportes
    (PILA)" one could study the effect of obtaining the PEP Pardon on
    the likelihood of obtaining a job in these new firms created by
    Venezuelans. If there is an effect, it would be related to the
    literature on the importance of networks in the job market like for
    example Calvó-Armengol (2004)[@temp_id_16677324939859028] or Kramarz
    and Skans (2014)[@temp_id_16424187389222356].

2.  In the panel specification, basically it's like a diff in diff
    approach between those who received and those who did not receive
    PEP. It is not that clear to me why those who did not receive it see
    an increase (albeit much lower) in entrepreneurship (see figure 7).
    Did something change?

3.   If there is also the date on where these persons received the visa,
    one could also use the panel data for an event study instead of a
    diff in diff, as a robustness check.

4.  The treatment effect by year seems to be statistically significant
    until 2022 and 2021 (figure 6). I was wondering about the mechanism
    that might explain this lagged effect.[^4] My prior is that to start
    a business, although having access to the banking and borrowing
    systems are important, having a credit history in a bank is as
    important and takes longer. The effects of the event study might be
    comparable with the findings on figure 6. However, this might also
    be because of the Covid.

5.  This is speculative, but you can use the identification of Bahar,
    Ibañez and Rozo (2021)[@temp_id_28603242681652996] at the municipal
    level to see aggregate effects on entrepreneurship. If it's only the
    sum of firms of persons with the PEP pardon, it would be a
    robustness check in the aggregate of some sort. If it is new firms
    in general, it would include the direct effect of having more
    entrepreneurs and the indirect effect of having a larger pool of
    workers, which might benefit all firms because of potentially
    cheaper labor. Although, given figure 6, it seems there is no effect
    for Colombian native firms.

6.  An improvement in the identification of papers like Bahar, Ibañez
    and Rozo (2021)[@temp_id_28603242681652996] might be done also. In
    there, they use as an instrument the average registration day
    available by department. One could compute not only the actual
    average registration days available by department but the expected
    one, using the same permutations done in the paper.

## Minor Suggestions

1\. In the introduction, in the first page, the authors argue that in
the panel data approach, they can decompose the immigrant
entrepreneurship effect into a physical relocation effect and a visa
effect. I firstly understood it as if the PEP-Pardon had an effect in
migration towards different cities (for example, if I am going to open a
business, maybe a big city like Medellín or Bogotá would be better).
Then later in the text they explain that the physical reallocation
effect is moving from Venezuela to Colombia. It could be my reading, but
it might be worth it to recheck it.

2\. Although it is a very good idea to present the assumptions in a
general context... It would \[also\] be useful if at the end of each
assumption, you could state for the case of the paper what would that
mean directly. It would help the reader to think straightforwardly if
the assumption is getting realized in the case of the study and to think
about potential threats in a more direct way.

3\. Table 8 and Table 9 show results for different sub-samples. Here,
the results in the panel regression differs from the results using the
IV cross-section. It would be important to explain these differences.

## Main Advice

Regarding the identification, the regression discontinuity design
compares outcomes among migrants who completed the RAMV, some earlier
than other, obtaining a greater time window for the legalization
process. Now, since both completing the RAMV earlier and having more
time to obtain the visa might be endogenous to the level of
entrepreneurship of the person, a source of randomness like
precipitation is cleverly used. In terms of the assumptions for the
instrument to work, they are well explained, and the context is a
context where the instrument can work. However, the strategy is based on
compliers whose PEP status was sensitive to the timing and length of the
window.

This is the part of the paper that might be harder to believe. Even the
people with a smaller time window had more than two months to get the
PEP visa. One could think having two months or having two months and one
week would not make such a difference, given the perks of being
legalized in a country. Although table 3 tries to compare a
classification of always takers vs compliers, one thing that could help
is if the document could talk about the time people took to obtain the
PEP visa. By this I mean the number of days from the date they could
start the process, to the date they submitted the documents online to
get the PEP visa. This would help to get an idea of how important is to
have one or two weeks more, for example.

## Conclusions

Overall, I find the paper very interesting, both methodologically and
empirically. It is very well done, and I would think it is very likely
to be published in a very good journal. I am not an expert in this field
nor in the econometric procedure, but I would start by aiming, with a
paper like this, for a top general interest journal and see the comments
and feedback from those type of reviewers.

# Evaluator details

1.  How long have you been in this field?

    -   My research focuses on applied work but not particularly related
        to labor or migration. So I would say, not so long ago.

2.  How many proposals and papers have you evaluated?

    -   3 journals, 9 master thesis.

    correcting a few typos and grammatical and punctuation errors.

[^4]: Manager's note: The authors responded to this comment and a
    similar one from the other evaluator:\
    \
    \> In short, we suspect that starting a business takes some time.
    Entrepreneurs must become familiar with their customers, potential
    suppliers, or possibly identify real estate and/or other supplies.
    In some cases, borrowing money could require a credit history with
    the bank that has

    to be established. For some types of businesses, licensing may be
    necessary. For these reasons, immigrants establishing new businesses
    would need time to set them up.
