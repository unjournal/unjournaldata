# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Does the Squeaky Wheel Get
More Grease? The Direct and Indirect Effects of Citizen Participation on
Environmental Governance in China" ([@Buntaine2022DOES]). Both
evaluators rate the paper highly, giving overall ratings of 80 and 90,
and stating that the paper 'should be' published in a 'top tier
(generalist)' journal, or a tier just below this (near-top or
top-field). To read these evaluations, please click the links at the

# Evaluation Manager's Notes

## On the status of this paper, the timing, and the authors' response

*In summary:*

-   The paper evaluated here is the most recent version of the paper
    that was publicly available from January-August 2023

-   The authors note they have made substantial revisions in the
    intervening nine months, although these have not been made public

-   The authors will consider responding to the evaluations below at
    some point in the future, noting the changes they have made. They
    may want to wait until after their paper has been accepted for
    publication in a traditional journal before they respond.

We reached out to all of the authors in January 2023 to let them know we
had chosen their (NBER) paper to be evaluated by The Unjournal as part
of our [direct evaluation
track](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track "null").
The authors did not respond.

It took us over six months to source evaluators for this paper, and get
responses. (This is far longer than our targeted turnaround time of
approximately 1-2 months).

We contacted the authors in mid-July to share the two completed
evaluations of their work, and to give them a chance to respond. The
authors replied to our email, noting that they had made "significant
revisions to the paper in the intervening nine months, including in
response to referees\' comments as part of the standard review process."
We suggested some options for their response. In a followup email they
stated "after some consideration, we have decided not to offer a
detailed response at this stage." However, they suggested that in the
future they would "consider offering a response and explanation about
how the paper has changed over time and how it is (or is not) responsive
to some of the questions raised by the evaluators". They suggested that
we reach out to them to follow this up.

We recognize that this example poses challenges for The Unjournal's
approach, and we are considering ways to better address this in the
future. In particular, we plan to more proactively and persistently
reach out to authors to inquire about the status of their papers (and
updated versions) before beginning our evaluation process.

## Why we chose this paper?

See this [recent Founder's
Pledge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9DLe1bX9V_66sj82RygPpPTCRaZbPUBK6OftR0_r5k/edit# "null")
report and summary as a source of some of the points below

-   Air pollution is a major global source of mortality, particularly in
    China, South Asia and Africa  

-   This is potentially underfunded ('neglected'), getting a low amount
    of 'funding per death' 

-   Whether more funding and attention is warranted depends on
    'tractability' (whether funds can have an impact), which depends in
    large part on the responsiveness and regulatory capacity of
    governments

-   This field experiment suggests (but maybe doesn't nail down) a
    potentially highly impactful and cost-effective intervention,
    perhaps involving social media appeals, or other forms of
    large-scale public social pressure 'bottom-up' participation

Furthermore, understanding the nature of the citizen/business/government
interaction in China seems highly relevant for a range of other global
priorities, including risks from dangerous technologies (perhaps AI,
biological 'gain of function' research) great-power conflict, and
cooperation on global public goods.

*"A potentially robust experimental design; the main conclusion (that
social media has a key role to play in encouraging compliance with
environmental policies) is pretty important; 4th industrial revolution/
social platforms as power"*

## Summary of evaluations

Both evaluators rate the paper highly, giving overall ratings of 80 and
90, and stating that the paper 'should be' published in a 'top tier
(generalist)' journal, or a tier just below this (near-top or
top-field). Both have engaged seriously and substantively, including
critiques of the econometrics and identification strategy.  The second
evaluation also provides a range of large and small specific suggestions
for robustness checks, improved exposition, and more.
