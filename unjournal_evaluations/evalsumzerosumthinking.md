# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Zero-Sum Thinking, the
Evolution of Effort-Suppressing Beliefs, and Economic Development"
[@nuo5k2hcv6l]. We asked two expert reviewers from different disciplines
to evaluate it, who ended up being fairly negative (especially E1) but
who both made substantive critiques regarding the assumptions,
conceptual framework, data analysis, and interpretation. To read these
evaluations, please see the links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

At its core, this paper formalizes and tests a theory posing that the
poor are poor because they do not work hard enough. I describe
conceptual, theoretical, and empirical issues.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

The paper introduces zero-sum environments to explain demotivating
beliefs proposing a model and using data from Congo and the World Values
Survey to support the model. It assumes demotivating beliefs to be
universally incorrect, which is unsupported. In contexts with corruption
or instability, hard work may not yield proportional outcomes, therefore
demotivating beliefs may reflect true states of the world, thus negating
the need for their model.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

This paper came to the Unjournal's attention because it is ambitious (in
a good way), linking culture --- or more precisely belief systems --- to
productivity, material welfare, and ultimately long-run growth. The
authors constitute a strong interdisciplinary team, and the paper has
been getting attention. We asked two expert reviewers from different
disciplines to evaluate it, who ended up being fairly negative
(especially E1) but who both made substantive critiques regarding the
assumptions, conceptual framework, data analysis, and interpretation.

In particular both \[evaluators\] felt that the umbrella term of
'demotivating beliefs' oversimplified by amalgamating highly disparate
ideas related to envy, witchcraft, and agency. While simplification and
generalization can serve a purpose, in this case they felt that it (a)
weakened the credibility of the assumption that such beliefs are
inherently incorrect; (b) stretched thin the ability to measure such
beliefs cleanly, undercutting some of the empirical results; and (c)
attenuated the links from the evolutionary model to the data to
real-world implications.

Please do read the reports in full, including E1's challenges to the
work of anthropologist George Fisher that helped lay the foundations for
and inspired this work, as well as the role of colonialism in moving
beyond zero-sum thinking. Meanwhile E2 has some concrete suggestions in
terms of the World Values Survey data and the formal analysis.

## Further notes[^27]

We asked [Claude.ai](Claude.ai "null") to highlight points of agreement
and disagreement between the two evaluations, enumerated below.

> *Areas of Agreement:*
>
> 1.  Both evaluations question the assumption in the paper that
>     demotivating beliefs are inherently incorrect. They argue these
>     beliefs may actually reflect the true state of the world in many
>     contexts with corruption, instability, or unfairness.
>
> 2.  Both point out issues with how concepts like witchcraft and envy
>     are measured in the empirical analysis. For example, equating
>     non-Christian beliefs with witchcraft is seen as problematic.
>
> 3.  Both suggest the correlations shown could have alternative
>     explanations, such as demotivating beliefs being an accurate
>     reflection of zero-sum environments, rather than validating the
>     evolutionary model proposed.
>
> 4.  Both critiques argue the paper oversimplifies by lumping together
>     very different concepts like witchcraft, envy and views on poverty
>     under the umbrella of \"demotivating beliefs.\"
>
> *Areas of Disagreement:*
>
> 1.  Evaluation 1 has a much more critical tone overall, arguing the
>     paper fails conceptually, theoretically and empirically.
>     Evaluation 2, while noting significant issues, has a more measured
>     critique.
>
> 2.  Evaluation 1 directly challenges the foundation of the paper by
>     extensively critiquing the original ideas of anthropologist George
>     Foster that inspired it. Evaluation 2 focuses its critique on the
>     assumptions and analysis in the current paper.
>
> 3.  Evaluation 1 takes great issue with the paper\'s discussion of
>     colonialism enabling Europe to grow beyond zero-sum thinking.
>     \[...\]
>
> 4.  Evaluation 2 makes several specific suggestions for improving the
>     analysis, such as using a hierarchical model and providing more
>     details on the WVS data. Evaluation 1 does not see a path to
>     sufficiently improve the paper.
>
> In summary, while both evaluations identify some similar core
> conceptual and empirical issues in the paper, Evaluation 1 is harsher
> in its critique and sees the flaws as insurmountable, while Evaluation
> 2, though still critical, provides more constructive feedback and
> seems to see potential for improvement.

## Author engagement

As always, we informed the authors in advance that we would be
commissioning their paper for evaluation. We shared these evaluations
with them and invited their response. We have not heard from them. If
they choose to respond, we will integrate the response here.

[^8]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^9]: At first glance this paper is looks very strong, as there is
    certainly much skill in their technique and story-telling. Closer
    inspection reveals the shaky foundations. In essence, it is a
    beautiful house of cards.

[^10]: The model is good, and overall the study can be very useful and
    relevant. However, the assumption of demotivating beliefs =
    incorrect beliefs is too problematic.

[^11]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^12]: I hope no interventions will be based upon the notion that
    believing the world can be unjust is just a pessimistic view of the
    world.

[^13]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to
    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^14]: The story-telling is so good that the reader easily forgets that
    a discussion of the appropriateness of the model or possible
    alternative explanations are not provided.

[^15]: While the methods are valid, the underlying assumption is wrong
    or to the very least unsupported. By changing this assumption, the
    model does not need the sorting and competitiveness pathway, and the
    inclusion of zero-sum environments is also in doubt. Other indices
    could be used instead. Therefore I think the model is wrong and
    that\'s why the low evaluation.

[^16]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^17]: Apart from the lack of reasoning of why demotivating beliefs are
    incorrect beliefs, in the rest of the paper, the authors do a great
    job.

[^18]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^19]: There is no mention about how to access their survey data. The
    cross-country dataset is well described.

[^20]: I would only comment, that the authors should clearly state which
    waves of the WVS they used.

[^21]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^22]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^23]: Manager's note: we are not posting all of this evaluators
    quantitative ratings and predictions as they did not seem to use our
    scales in the intended way. E.g., they gave 'certainties' rather
    than a belief distribution.

    Their aggregate and overall normative ratings were very low, i.e.,
    very negative.

[^24]: The evaluator wrote "I believe it should not be published."

[^25]: Its a difficult question to answer. With the current form, I
    think it should not be published. If the paper relaxes the
    assumption of inherently incorrect demotivating beliefs and see what
    happens, it has much better potential.

[^26]: I think it will be published in a top 5 journal. It is after all
    a \"great paper\" built on a shaky foundation by an all-star team.

    director.
