# Written report

**Summary:** This paper uses a field experiment to explore the impact of
a 12-week CBT program among poor households in rural Ghana. The authors
find that the CBT program increases mental and physical well-being, as
well as cognitive and socioemotional skills and downstream economic
outcomes. There are no heterogeneous treatment effects by baseline
mental health. However, a measure of vulnerability to mental distress
does predict the impact of CBT on mental and physical health, but not on
cognitive and socioemotional skills or downstream economic outcomes. The
authors argue that CBT operates via two channels: It alleviates
vulnerability to mental distress for those most at-risk, and it also
generates greater cognitive bandwidth across the population.

**Major comments:** This paper addresses an important topic in
development economics with clear policy implications; if effective, CBT
programs could improve not just mental well-being but also, as this
paper suggests, key downstream economic outcomes at a relatively low
cost. There is relatively little large-scale, well-identified work on
the impacts of CBT in low-income, developing country contexts, and as
such additional evidence is quite valuable. The paper is also clearly
written and a pleasure to read.

1.  My more substantial comments primarily regard my desire to better
    understand both the context and results. I understand (and
    appreciate!) the concise writing, but at times the paper felt a bit
    barebones. In particular:\

    A. Nods to attrition, balance, and other "standard" discussions in
    experimental work were missing from the main text. As far as I could
    tell attrition was not once mentioned, and yet it seems likely that
    all participants did not in fact complete all 12 weeks of the CBT
    program; similarly I would expect that some participants did not
    respond to the follow-up survey. This feels quite important to
    report to the readers, at least in a footnote. In the case of
    balance, I found the rich discussion of the randomization procedure
    in Appendix A to be quite compelling and worth at least some
    reference in the main text, in part just to clearly state the
    variables for which balance was (or was not) ultimately achieved.
    \[*Evaluation manager's note: the authors do consider and report on
    attrition in the AER-Insights published version.\]*

    \
    B. I would have appreciated access to survey materials, either via
    the appendix or the authors' websites. It is possible to access the
    CBT program guide online, but from what I can tell this does not
    include the questions that make up the survey and lab outcomes
    included in the analysis. This is important for several reasons.
    Three that come to mind in particular:

    -   I was a bit puzzled as to the selection of mental health
        outcomes. Three question types were included in an index
        (presumably these were the only three relevant questions asked
        in the survey?), but only one of the question types (K10) is
        included in many of the key analyses. The K10 score also happens
        to be the outcome with the most statistically precise and
        positive treatment effect but with quite variable scores over
        time, which makes an understanding of the decision to focus on
        this outcome especially important. Access to the survey
        materials would help readers to understand this selection
        decision, as well as the wording of the particular questions
        that made up the index.

    -   Access to the survey would also allow readers to better
        understand how experimenter demand may affect self-reports,
        which was not discussed in the paper. Were participants aware
        that the survey questions were related to their participation in
        the CBT program, for instance, or was this link obfuscated? This
        is important for the interpretation of study findings, and
        perhaps for understanding the difference between these results
        and the Haushofer et al findings (see more on this below).

    -   More generally, access would be appreciated for ease of
        replication and/or scale-up efforts.

    C. On page 4 when discussing the hypothesis that the poor are
    particularly vulnerable to mental health difficulties, it would be
    helpful to point to empirical data supporting this claim. Similarly,
    when discussing the observed baseline rates of mental health in this
    sample, it would be helpful to see how the data compare with other
    samples. There is a note on page 8 comparing the BRFSS averages in
    the US to the K10 scores collected in Ghana. Given that the authors
    also collect at least one BRFSS question in the Ghana sample, I
    would encourage them to report this here for the sake of comparison
    to the US sample.

2.  My preference would have been to put a bit less weight in the
    introduction and discussion on the particular mechanisms underlying
    how CBT operates. The data suggest that CBT has some impact on
    downstream outcomes (cognitive, socioemotional, and economic)
    independent of the effect it has on mental and physical wellbeing,
    largely because a measure of vulnerability to mental distress only
    predicts treatment effects for mental and physical wellbeing. As a
    result, the authors claim that "CBT directly improves bandwidth,
    increasing cognitive and socioemotional skills and hence economic
    outcomes." However -- especially given that there are not
    heterogeneous effects by predicted bandwidth -- I would encourage
    the authors to discuss the scarcity mechanism as one possible
    mechanism, rather than suggesting that this channel has been
    mechanistically isolated. My sense is that the note in the
    conclusion that "the poor can generally benefit from CBT whether
    they have mental health problems or not" nicely captures the policy
    implications of these findings, and I would encourage this set of
    results to be more broadly framed in this light.\

3.  The authors appropriately cite a Haushofer et al
    ([@temp_id_9102980599503354]) paper which finds no impact of a
    5-week CBT training program at a 12-month follow-up. While it is of
    course no critique of this paper that different results were
    observed here, the difference does raise questions about how the
    respective studies ought to inform our posterior. To aid in this
    endeavor, I would like to see a somewhat more complete discussion of
    the two sets of results. For instance, it seems worth mentioning why
    a 12-month follow-up wasn't collected here to best compare results;
    was it because the other treatments in this trial had begun to be
    implemented, and so the randomization was no longer clean? The
    authors also suggest that perhaps given the Haushofer et al results
    there may be fade out in the longer run (Haushofer et al may have
    also observed effects if they looked at shorter-run outcomes). But
    if this is the case that significantly impacts how we interpret the
    value of the CBT program, and so a longer-run follow-up in this
    context would be very valuable. Finally, another related paper that
    seems worth including in this broader discussion is Bhat et al
    ([@temp_id_8448813715968049]).\

4.  While this is not an actionable suggestion, it seems worth noting
    that a pre-analysis plan would in my view have been quite useful for
    this project. For instance, it would have allowed the authors to
    clarify why the analysis focuses on the particular K10 outcome (Was
    it a question of power \[but then why not rely on the full index\]?
    Was it necessary to restrict the outcomes for a secondary
    analysis?). It would have also provided a space to register
    decisions such as pooling the control group households in CBT
    treatment communities with the control group households in control
    communities.\

## Minor comments:

1.  I found the degree of churn in the K10 mental wellbeing scores over
    time to be a bit surprising. It would be helpful to see the
    correlations between K10 and the other mental wellbeing measures.
    Was there a similar degree of churn over time across these measures?

2.  It seems as though there is a lot of rich data here, and indeed even
    more that could perhaps be gleaned. I was interested in a few
    questions around spillovers that might be further discussed, for
    instance:

    -   a\. Both adults in control households are included in the
        analysis, but only the treated member of the treated household
        is included. This presents a nice opportunity to look at
        spillovers for spouses of treated participants: I'm interested
        in what the data tell us?

    ```{=html}

    -   b\. The lack of spillover effects in general is rather
        interesting, and I would have liked to see more on this.

3.  The randomization procedures described in Appendix A are very neat
    -- a great way to ensure proper balance. I'd suggest including some
    of this discussion in the main text, at least in a footnote.

4.  More table notes would be appreciated, e.g. for Table 1.

5.  There is a typo in footnote 17; "results" is not spelled correctly.
