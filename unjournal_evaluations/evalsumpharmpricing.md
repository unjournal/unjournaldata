# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Pharmaceutical Pricing and
R&D as a Global Public Good" [@nrw3tmhqb7c]. This work considers global
drug pricing and whether, relative to the United States, the rest of the
world underpays for pharmaceuticals, underfunding R&D as a public good.
The authors quantify cross-country differences in drug prices, benchmark
these against willingness-to-pay thresholds, and discuss the
implications for international pricing negotiations. The evaluators
agree that the paper tackles an important problem with the potential for
real-world policy impact, positive or negative. Both were moderately
critical of the paper, providing overall percentile ratings of 51 and
31, i.e., at or below the median "relative to all serious research in
the same area that you have encountered in the last three years." Both
evaluators questioned the practical credibility of the claim that ROW
"should" pay more, noting the complexities of domestic U.S. pricing
systems, insurance structures, and bargaining power. The evaluators'
feedback offers a constructive path forward: clarifying empirical
claims, grounding recommendations in realistic policy mechanisms, and
ensuring transparency about limitations. To read these evaluations,

**Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of pharmaceutical research
and development (R&D) as a global public good, highlighting the
contributions made by various countries. It successfully gathers
valuable data and employs innovative methods to calculate marginal
costs. However, the empirical approach could be improved by addressing
omitted variable bias and incorporating general equilibrium effects.
Furthermore, the conceptual framework could be broadened to include
dynamic factors and supply-side considerations.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

**Strengths and achievements:**\
1. Applies a classic public-good model to explain why U.S. drug prices
exceed those in ROW and remain below the global optimum\
2. Empirical markups dispel the notion that non-U.S. markets fully
free-ride\
Positive GDP--price correlation aligns with theoretical predictions\
\
**Critiques, limitations, and suggestions:**\
1. Empirical tests are correlational and could have alternate
explanations\
2. Theoretical results rest on the assumption of optimal centralized
government action\
3. Policy prescriptions likely warrant further empirical validation\

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

## Why we chose this paper

We selected this paper because it tackles an important and controversial
policy question: whether the rest of the world underpays for
pharmaceuticals relative to the United States, potentially underfunding
global pharmaceutical R&D as a public good. The authors quantify
cross-country differences in drug prices, benchmark these against
willingness-to-pay thresholds, and discuss the implications for
international pricing negotiations. Framing pharmaceutical innovation
explicitly as a public good is both timely and potentially impactful,
especially given ongoing debates about equitable access, global health
priorities, and incentives for innovation.

## How we chose the evaluators

We deliberately paired two complementary perspectives. One evaluator has
domain expertise in pharmaceutical markets, health economics, and global
pricing policy. The other has strong empirical and econometric
experience but is not a domain specialist. This mix was chosen to ensure
the paper was evaluated both on its economic modeling and empirical
strategy, and on its policy relevance, plausibility of its assumptions,
and broader health-system context.

## Author engagement

The authors were aware of our process but chose not to engage. As
always, we invite their future response which we can share here.

##  Issues meriting further consideration

The evaluations highlight that while the paper explores an important
question, several core claims require closer scrutiny. Both evaluators
questioned the practical credibility of the claim that ROW "should" pay
more, noting the complexities of domestic U.S. pricing systems,
insurance structures, and bargaining power. One evaluator flagged the
risk of the analysis being used to justify higher prices without
sufficient attention to market failures or mechanisms for coordination.
The other noted that some key literature (e.g., on willingness-to-pay
benchmarks) was not fully integrated or cited. Overall, the evaluations
suggest that clarifying these assumptions and better addressing
real-world complexities would strengthen the paper and mitigate risks of
misinterpretation.

##  Conclusion

This evaluation process confirms that the paper tackles an important
problem with the potential for real-world policy impact, positive or
negative. The evaluators' feedback offers a constructive path forward:
clarifying empirical claims, grounding recommendations in realistic
policy mechanisms, and ensuring transparency about limitations. We see
this as exactly the kind of discussion The Unjournal aims to support,
helping authors refine their work for maximum rigor and relevance.

    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.
