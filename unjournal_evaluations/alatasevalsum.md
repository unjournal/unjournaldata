# **Overall ratings**

*1 Mar 2024 note: *The description of the "overall assessment" and
"journal rank tier" below reflects our *current *practice. However,
these evaluators were part of our pilot, and received slightly different
instructions. See
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators/why-these-guidelines#adjustments-to-metrics-and-guidelines-previous-presentations "null")
to learn how this changed, and to see the earlier instructions.

\
We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments, in addition to
ratings for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment:**[^1]** **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^2]** **"On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null"))"
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best".*

# Evaluation summaries

*ChatGPT summaries below*[^4]

## Anonymous evaluator (ChatGPT summary)  

*Strengths:*

-   Innovative approach to dissecting the impact of celebrity
    endorsements on spreading public health messages.

-   Significant contribution to filling the research gap on the efficacy
    of celebrity endorsements in social media campaigns.

*Critiques and suggestions:*

-   Concerns about the measurement of retweet/like behavior and its
    potential confounds, such as visibility differences across
    experimental conditions.

-   Questions the direct applicability of social media behavior metrics
    (likes, retweets) to actual vaccination rates and behaviors in the
    real world.

-   Calls for clarity on experimental setups, particularly how celebrity
    authorship versus endorsement was distinguished and its effect on
    user engagement.

-   Advocates for the public availability of the study\'s data and code
    to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and further analysis by the
    research community.

## Anirudh Tagat (ChatGPT summary)

*Strengths:*

-   Novel and rigorous experimental design focusing on celebrity
    endorsements in health communication within Indonesia.

-   Significant methodological contribution in disentangling the
    endorsement effect from the reach effect using randomized variation.

-   Important findings on the impact of celebrity-originated messages on
    public engagement and the counterintuitive effect of credible
    sourcing on message engagement.

-   Evidence suggesting real-world impacts of social media campaigns on
    vaccine-related knowledge and beliefs.

*Critiques and suggestions:*

-   Concerns about causal inference, particularly the impact of messages
    on offline knowledge and beliefs, suggesting these are correlations
    rather than causations.

-   Methodological suggestions include accounting for the dynamic nature
    of tweet engagement using timestamps and considering the role of
    emotions in message virality.

-    Questions the uniformity of the study\'s randomization across all
    Twitter users due to the platform\'s algorithm, potentially
    affecting the study\'s generalizability.

-   Recommends supplementing self-report data with secondary data on
    immunization rates to strengthen claims about the campaign\'s
    effectiveness.

# Unjournal Process/ Evaluation Manager's Notes

***Note on versions:**** *

Each evaluator considered the most recent version of the working paper
that was available at the time of their evaluation.[^9]

-   Evaluator 1 (anonymous) considered the February 2022 (Stanford)
    working paper version titled ["Designing Effective Celebrity
    Messaging Results From a Nationwide Twitter Experiment Promoting
    Vaccination in
    Indonesia"](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/ACMOP.pdf "null")

-   Evaluator 2 (Anirudh Tagat): Considered the May 2023 (MIT) working
    paper version titled "[Do Celebrity Endorsements Matter: A Twitter
    Experiment Promoting Vaccination In
    Indonesia](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/Indonesia_Twitter_Paper.pdf "null")"

This paper was selected as part of our [(NBER) direct evaluation
track](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track "null").

## Why we chose this paper

This work seems important methodologically and practically, both for
understanding the effect of social media (and perhaps 'polarization' as
well) and for health and other interventions involving debiasing and
education (e.g., Development Media International). 

## How we chose the evaluators

We sought expertise in

-   Empirical (econometric-style) analysis with peer-effects/networks,
    direct and indirect effects, causal inference

-   Field experiments (on social media), social media data (esp.
    Twitter)

-   Vaccine adoption, global health, Indonesian context

## Evaluation process

-   We shared [this
    document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZIF7gRhNLDK9liKc_ESYpv2jIX1RwaXAW9QotLsFbw/edit "null")
    with evaluators, suggesting some ways in which the paper might be
    considered in more detail

-   This process took over 8 months --- far longer than expected and
    targeted. Delays occurred because:

    -   We had difficulty commissioning qualified evaluators.

    -   One highly qualified evaluator agreed to the assignment but was
        not able to find the time to complete it

    -   With a third evaluator (in between the two mentioned above) we
        had a communication error. The evaluator considered a much
        earlier version of the paper (the 2019 NBER version). Thus we
        are not posting this evaluation.

-   Because of these delays we requested Anirudh Tagat, a member of our
    Management Team, to write the second (final) evaluation. We do not
    see any obvious conflicts of interest here. Anirudh did not select
    this paper for evaluation, did not reach out to evaluators, and had
    no strong connection to the authors. Anirudh will exempt himself for
    consideration of the 'most informative evaluation' prize (or will
    exempt himself from the adjudication of this).

-    As per The Unjournal's policy, the paper's authors were invited and
    given two weeks to provide a public response to these evaluations
    before we posted them. They did not provide a response, but they are
    invited to do so in the future (and if they do, we will post and
    connect it here).

    to write these brief summaries themselves.

    rating' on a scale of 1-5. See discussion

[^7]: They were asked to give these as a percentile "relative to all
    serious research in the same area that you have encountered in the
    last three years."

[^8]: The evaluator states that they considered these measures as
    percentiles; these were considered to be in the top 1% relative to a
    reference group of authors/papers "that does social media
    experiments to provide evidence on health communication via these
    channels:"

[^9]: We commissioned a third evaluation in between these, but there was
    a communication error. The evaluator considered a much earlier
    version of the paper (the 2019 NBER version). Thus we do not include
    this evaluation.
