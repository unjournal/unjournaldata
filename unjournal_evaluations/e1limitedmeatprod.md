# Abstract 

The review finds Rethink Priorities' 2022 cultured meat forecast
methodologically sound but limited and misleading. It critiques the
pessimistic framing, exclusion of luxury-product adoption, and potential
premature impact on funding. Despite uncertainty on mass scale by 2050,
falling input costs and emerging luxury markets suggest greater promise
than implied. Still, success depends on scaling, adoption, and
investment.

# Written report

The 2022 Rethink Priorities report, entitled "[Forecasts estimate
limited cultured meat production through
2050](https://rethinkpriorities.org/research-area/forecasts-estimate-limited-cultured-meat-production-through-2050/),"
reported the aggregated estimates of a panel of forecasters and a single
expert on a set of questions about the probability of various cultured
meat production and sales figures for the coming three decades. There
are different topics I will attempt to address in evaluating this work.
The first is evaluating the research as performed and reported,
including the soundness and the methodological limits of the exercise,
and the resulting validity of the directly resulting outputs. The second
is understanding and evaluating the generalizability, including the
assumptions, specifically whether assumptions or limitations of the
methods impacts the resulting conclusions, and what this means for the
implications of the report.

To foreshadow the conclusions, I find several minor issues with the
first set of topics (methodology) but very major issues with the second
set (framing and conclusions) - though this partly reflects my inside
view, formed in large part before the work was done. Critically, the
presentation of the Techno-Economic Analyses did not clarify that these
analyses are conditional estimates, not predictions, and that high price
scenarios were all based on the present-day costs as of the publication
time, (which have since dropped significantly) not predicted future
cost.

## Ignores transformative AI

Note that for this evaluation, I accept / adopt the (now much harder to
support) assumption of the report that this is "conditional on no
transformative AI arriving before the \[predictions'\] resolution."
Changes on this front seem likely to be disastrous, and increasingly
inevitable - but short of actual catastrophe, AI seems likely to
accelerate technology adoption, and so make any transition to cultured
meat faster.

*Note*: I was made aware of [a new
article](https://www.proteinreport.org/articles/the-case-for-cultured-meat-has-changed/)
that argues the substantive conclusion of the 2022 report is incorrect
after this was finalized - the writeup does not reflect the points made
there.

## Evaluating the research methods

### Forecasting methods

**Small sample limitations**\
The forecast exercise was well designed, albeit with a small sample. It
is understandable but additionally unfortunate that this severely limits
the conclusions which can be drawn from the difference in views between
the single expert and the five forecasters.[^8] Given the small sample,
there was a fairly clear split in views, where forecasters one and two
were quite optimistic, whereas three through six were pessimistic.

**Lack of discussion and updating** \
It is somewhat unfortunate that the forecasters and the expert were not
given an opportunity to discuss and update, as this is an important part
of what enables superforecaster success. Specifically, Gardner and
Tetlock's (2015) [@njbahlk233k] book points out that discussion dynamics
and structured collaboration significantly amplify performance compared
to individual experts, due to shared reasoning and cross-examination of
assumptions. Platforms like Metaculus enable this to some extent, by
providing comments and information about other forecasts and the
aggregate.

**Geometric means → lower estimates**\
Pooling using geometric means is very reasonable as a way to account for
extreme probabilities, but also provides almost uniformly lower
estimates in this study than a simple average. (The transformation into
odds had the additional effect of generally reducing the aggregated
estimates, though this was mixed.)

**Magnitude of units error in the table for Delft overstating the cost
of FGF2 1000x**\
A potentially critical issue was found with the table provided to
forecasters and experts for question 24, which says that the Delft
analysis had a cost of FGF2/kg of 1.3-2.3B/kg, while the report itself,
in table 3, this was the cost per gram, making the numbers approximately
3x what was reported for Humbird, not 3,000x. (The Risner et al price
was, in fact, 1000x higher - but was also focused on the promise of
eliminating FGF2, i.e. setting the price to zero. Notably, this is a
possibility that the forecasts do not seem to take into account.) I do
not know enough about this to check it in depth.

### Results Reporting

**Overstated conclusions, hidden disagreement**\
First, the small number of forecasters seems to lead to an overstatement
of the strength of the arguments on which to base the conclusions, and
lacking uncertainty ranges compounds this. The aggregate reported
results, most notably, a 9% chance of greater than 50m metric tons of
cultured meat sold in 2051, hide the disagreement, in this case, the
fact that two forecasters reported a greater than 40% probability of
this occurring. This is importantly misleading, especially given the
conclusions.

Otherwise, the reporting of results seems clear, and the reported
results generally make sense, with two exceptions; consumer acceptance,
and investment.

**Consumer acceptance, misinterpretation of conditional probabilities**
For the evaluation of consumer approval, it seems strange to report the
absence of correlations between predictions of wide scale protests and
willingness to try, given that they are conditional, and the conditional
effectively screens off correlation. This undermines the claim that
"consumer approval did not appear as a major constraint," especially
because the direction of causation is unclear, and the relationships
over time between consumer approval/acceptance and the volume of
production will clearly have feedback loops.

**David Reinstein (manager) notes**

**Investment, misinterpretation of causality**\
Similarly, the correlation between investment and funding and cultured
meat production is partly a function of similar feedback loops.
Forecasters are not predicting a casual relationship, they are
predicting outcomes. If investment or subsidies were high, this would
impact the production volume - and given increasing returns to scale,
this might be a virtuous loop. On the other hand, regardless of
viability, if investments and subsidies are low, production will be low.
It seems especially unfortunate as this may have become a
self-fulfilling prediction; discussions since 2022 reveal that the
report itself decreased philanthropic funding, making the field less
likely to achieve its potential.

### Cruxes

First, it is particularly valuable and commendable to have clearly
reported reasoning and the structural relationship between the causes of
cultured meat production being low or high and the different prior
analyses. Doing so as a way to update from prior work in detail, rather
than simply reviewing prior work and presenting a conclusion, is
incredibly valuable and yet often unusual in research. (This type of
synthesis is often left for systematic reviews, which then aggregate
results without decomposing the issues, compounding the problem!)

The formal methods which could have supported building an explicit
structural equation based on expert views and estimation of such a model
are absent, but would have required a much different type of project.
Still, it would have been valuable, and it is good that the next best
approach was used.

That is, reporting the relationships qualitatively based on provided
comments seems like a good compromise. It is harder to justify
methodologically, as no formal qualitative analysis occurred, but in
this review I care less about methodological purity than correctness,
and in this case have little concern that the work here was not
correctly explained. A minor comment is that I would have further
confidence if the forecasters were explicitly shown the report and had a
chance to comment - and again, it would have been even better if they
had been given a chance to update their views. (However, I also note
that if the explanation were materially misleading, there could have
been responses on the Forum Post which I expect the forecasters would
have seen - and no such comments have been made.)

## Evaluating Framing and the Question of TEAs

The fundamental question which is being asked is whether cultured meat
is a viable product or industry, and what would allow it to succeed. For
this reason, the focus of the questions on specific product types, and
the technology trajectory, are critical.

Doing so without the benefit of hindsight is functionally impossible, so
this discussion will inevitably be at least somewhat unfair to the
report's discussion, which was produced close to four years ago.

### Techno-Economic Analysis

To begin discussion of the report's framing, we need to address TEAs,
introductions to which can be found here;
[1](https://netl.doe.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/5.%20Hackett%20-%20Techno-Economic%20Analysis%20091322.pdf),
[2](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/2022-01-19%20-%20Intro%20to%20TEA%20-%20Slides%20and%20Transcript_compliant_1_0.pdf),
and a more detailed but narrow overview
[here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://netl.doe.gov/projects/files/QGESSPerformingaTechno-economicAnalysisforPowerGenerationPlantsReport_070115.pdf&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1756909317909041&usg=AOvVaw2E7ZT2Hw8ysj5TccFx4IlY).
(These are focused on energy technologies.) While I am not an expert in
the area, it seems important to note that fundamentally, TEAs are not
predictions, they are conditional analyses. That is, they focus on an
in-development technology, and consider what specific changes to a
technology's inputs would allow.

Prediction of changes to input prices are partially premised on no
significant changes to the technology. They can, however, be used to
address such questions. The Rethink report unfortunately presents the
TEA results - from
[Delft](https://cedelft.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CE_Delft_190254_TEA_of_Cultivated_Meat_FINAL_corrigendum.pdf)
(2021) [@nf5ivpstf49],
[Humbird](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348009195_Scale-Up_Economics_for_Cultured_Meat_Techno-Economic_Analysis_and_Due_Diligence)
(2021) [@n6hoje7oksb], and [Risner et
al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.292144v1.full)
(2020) [@n1diw17jwkb] without clarifying that the different price
estimates were for different scenarios, and all of the highest price
scenarios were present-day costs as of the publication time, not
projections.

It is again unfair to the research to note that in retrospect, the
situation has changed - but it is they were using current prices for
inputs, and retrospective evaluation itself is valid. Given that, I will
note that in the 5 years since the publication of the TEAs, costs for
inputs like FGF-2 have already come down by a couple orders of
magnitude, below the ranges of analysed costs for 2 of the 3 studies.
And the question of lowered input prices [was
discussed](https://x.com/davidmanheim/status/1420723315484864514)
\[link: X/Twitter thread\] with one author at the time the study was
being performed.

To explain the further questions about framing, assumptions, and
generalizability, I will first digress briefly to explain how I see
adoption in general, and apply it to this case. Again, some of this is
probably unfairly retrodictive, seeing advances in the past several
years since the report was released.

### Technology Adoption Pathways

Fundamentally, the way technology evolves in successful domains is by
successive changes to the technology, often spurred by greater adoption
and scaling, which reduce prices and increase quality or output, feeding
a virtuous cycle.

In starting that cycle, technology adoption typically follows a process,
where consumer "innovators" start using a new technology, and then early
adopters, and so on. Three key barriers to this exist: consumer
adoption, returns to scale, and timelines. If consumers in the
successive categories: of innovators, early adopters, early majority,
etc. do not want the product at the available price points, the scaling
cannot continue. If there are limited or insufficient returns to scale,
prices do not come down enough, and quality does not improve enough, to
enable cheaper products acceptable to larger parts of the market. And if
timelines are longer than expected, companies or industries can falter,
for example, running out of investment capital and generating too-low
returns to continue, and the market can collapse. (But timelines can
also sometimes slip significantly without this occurring. Famously, for
Musk's companies, I'm unaware of a case where Tesla or SpaceX did
anything as quickly as initially promised!)

But we need to be careful, because \[while\] the typical story follows
the paper's analysis and assumes a single technology product - \[in
contrast,\] when looking at something like cultured meat, we are
considering a class of products, more like "electric vehicle" than
"solar panel." And as noted, successful companies or industries often
start by marketing a luxury product to prove viability, and expect
production prices to come down with scale. As an obvious example, Tesla
began with an electric sports car, then expanded to a luxury sedan, and
at least initially had the idea that it would culminate in a low-cost
vehicle.

### The Cultured Meat Case \[and luxury products\]

Given the three barriers, I want to break down the question, and
consider the path for luxury products. The discussion in the research
was focused on adoption of meat in general, and didn't explicitly
consider this. In fact, this critical issue for the analysis is ignored;
meat is not a single product, it is a very significant range of products
with different relevant characteristics and price points. Much like
"electric car" was a range of products, we expect that successful
adoption curves go through luxury products first.

But all of the TEAs were about the case for mass production of meat, not
luxury products. Because TEAs are used for cost-benchmarking, and
require a comparator, this will be misleading. The Delft TEA used a
comparator of "slurry or paste made out of meat cells," which could be
sold as something like ground beef, while the other two did not have an
explicit product comparators. (Humbird (2021) [@nmjqw43jnu8] and Risner
et al (2020) [@n5b95k063z4] also mention prices for hamburgers in
passing. On the other hand, Risner et al also explicitly notes, "there
may be opportunity for viable competition in the specialty foods
markets, where ACBM costs compare more favorably to such items as almas
beluga caviar (USD 10,000/kg), Atlantic bluefin tuna (USD 6500/kg), and
foie gras (USD 1232/kg) \[57\]")

Consumer adoption seems like a critical barrier when considering
mass-market adoption, but is far less concerning for luxury products; as
[Business Insider put
it](https://www.businessinsider.com/lab-grown-caviar-meat-biotech-2023-1),
"Being ethical is the new luxury." Capturing a fraction of the luxury
market is enough for profitability, at least in the interim - and
doesn't require scaling up to nearly the same extent.

## Generalizability, Assumptions, and Conditionals; where things stand today

Neil said that he would change his mind if there was "Public
demonstrations of large batch production (\>1,000 metric tons \[at any
price\]) in the next two years." It has been three, and this has not
happened. On the other hand, given regulatory and production delays, I
think we'll have significant updates over the coming year, with
factories coming online. Wildtype, Upside foods, and Believer Meats all
have projects which have capacity to produce over 10,000kg/year online
sometime in 2024/2025. Upside food for chicken, and Wildtype's salmon
are targeting in the range of 25-250 tons each. A third company, Good
meat, claimed in late 2023 that it could scale production to 1,300 tons
at their new production facility, though there is no evidence they did
so, and even then, it would have happened later than the suggested
demonstration \[of actual production\] that Neil suggested.

Smaller production volumes for luxury product is also starting.
Wildtype's pitch starts into the slightly higher priced products, as
traditional salmon sells for over \$10/pound, approximately double the
price of ground chuck beef, and easily quadruple the price of whole
chicken. But [Vow
foods](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/18/australia-approves-sale-of-lab-grown-fake-meat)
is now producing \[lab-grown\] pate and foie gras; both seem to address
a luxury market segment at prices closer to \$100/kg, with a successful
single batch production of half a metric ton. They claim to be able to
produce over a ton per week, which would be a scale similar to the lower
cost meat production of other firms.

The question now is whether the adoption of small amounts of luxury
goods really leads to drastic price decreases for mass market consumer
goods. Tesla, again, is an interesting comparator; they still have not
managed to do what was originally promised, and delivered an electric
car cheaper than comparable gasoline cars - though [recent
analyses](https://atlaspolicy.com/comparing-the-total-cost-of-ownership-of-the-most-popular-vehicles-in-the-united-states-2025-update/)
do show that total cost can be lower.

None of these are reaching the levels needed to replace meat. On the
other hand, the production volumes are potentially finally reaching
levels that could potentially spur the virtuous cycle of price
reductions. Given that, I expect the forecast average correctly
predicted a failure to reach 100,000 metric tons by 2031 - but see the
46% prediction of reaching that volume by 2051, in retrospect, as being
far too low; Tesla may not have made electric cars affordable, but the
technology had, and has, far more ability to drop in price.

## Conclusions

The summary of the report suggests that "The main cruxes of disagreement
appear to stem from \[differences in\] beliefs \[over\] how often
technology can replicate and outperform biological systems, \[over the\]
choice of reference classes, and \[over\] how much to anchor based on
the estimates in the Humbird (2021) [@nqov1bo5i28] techno-economic
analysis."

I think this is correct, but betrays confusion on the part of the
analysis. The question should not be just focused on how often
technology can replicate and outperform biological systems, but how
*quickly* it can occur. I agree with the conclusions of the report that
the timelines and near-term predictions for cultivated meat do not seem
to plausibly support the optimistic predictions that were made by both
industry and consultancies for the coming decade or two.

If we want to ask the question, "Is Cultured Meat likely to be
commercially viable in the near to medium term?" It seems the answer
should be yes, despite not reaching very large scale volume. But the
analysis doesn't address this question; profitable luxury products are
implicitly excluded. On the other hand, this \[small-scale luxury
production\] does not directly address the question of the eventual
impact on animal welfare.

That is where the final conclusions seem greatly overstated; a 50%
chance that a material proportion of meat is from cultured sources is
also necessarily envisioning a scenario where there is immense pressure
to solve the technological problems. And the case for reaching
price-parity does not need to be airtight to justify investment, for a
few reasons. First, the cost of cultured meat isn't the only relevant
trend; as the continued critical need to stop and reverse climate change
meets the growing demand in the developing world for luxury goods like
meat, it seems likely that both the price, and legal, moral, and
economic pressures \[on\] traditional meat production, increase. Second,
the case for reaching price-parity does not need to be airtight to
justify investment; a 1-in-11 chance that over 50M metric tons of
cultured meat is produced in 2051 is plausibly a good investment just
based on the return on investment; the philanthropic impact adds to
that. Lastly, whether or not the world reaches net-zero by 2050, and
whether or not ethical pressure against factory farmed meat consumption
accelerates, there is reason to expect cellular agriculture to become
increasingly prominent as a target for investment. It seems very likely
that something will displace current factory farming. And unless the
barriers to cultured meat are far stronger than the ones suggested in
the analyses, it seems cultured meat still has a significant chance of
being a large part of that change.

Of course, the promise of cultured meat is not realized by reaching 50m
metric tons, but by displacing the current production of well over 500m
metric tons of meat and seafood yearly - a number that is increasing
rapidly as the developing world gets richer. But the trajectory to get
there is important, and seems to route through current progress in
artificial meat. A principle unaddressed question for the timeline,
then, is whether humanity is willing to invest in longer-time-frame
innovations that will pay off later. Philanthropic funding seems likely
to play a key role - so for those who prioritize animal welfare, the
partial cessation of funding based on this analysis seems very
unfortunate.

[^1]: This paper was evaluated as part of our "applied and policy
    stream", described
    [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2).
    The ratings should not be directly compared to those in our main
    academic stream.

[^2]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^3]: We asked evaluators to rank this paper "heuristically" as a
    percentile "relative to applied and policy research you have read
    aiming at a similar audience, and with similar goals." We requested
    they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to
    future impactful applied research, and practical relevance and
    usefulness."

[^4]: However, for this particular case we de-emphasized the ratings
    aspect. We asked evaluators to focus on (1) whether the claims made
    in the paper were valid and up-to-date and (2) things that the
    authors could have been done better, particularly considering ways
    to future synthesis and forecasting exercises better.

[^5]: This comes from the form. If the author didn't do this, please
    skip this section.

[^6]: The evaluator was given the following instructions: Identify the
    most important and impactful factual claim this research makes --
    e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^7]: "Feel free to express this in terms of the probability of the
    claim being true or as a credible interval for the parameter being
    estimated."

[^8]: This split is common, and has been seen in similar exercises,
    notably but not at all exclusively for long term forecasts. The
    clearest example which comes to mind is the XPT Tournament,
