*Manager's note: This response was shared by Michael Walker, "on behalf
of the paper authors".*

We thank the Unjournal \[evaluation manager\] and evaluators for helpful
comments on the paper "Intergenerational Child Mortality Effects of
Deworming: Experimental Evidence from Two Decades of the Kenya Life
Panel Survey." We are currently in the process of revising the paper,
and will take these comments into consideration (along with other
feedback from referees), and will update this note to point readers to
relevant parts of the revised paper when available.

There are two initial points that we wanted to note:

1.  The version of the paper reviewed by the evaluators was written to
    meet "short paper" requirements at economics journals, which
    typically require no more than 5 exhibits and 6,000 words. As this
    is substantially shorter than many full-length economics papers, it
    necessitated some difficult choices on measures and analyses to
    focus on in the main paper. We are currently expanding the paper to
    a full-length economics article which will provide additional space
    for more details and analyses raised by the evaluators.

2.  We wish to clarify a point around Evaluator 2's comment on the
    pre-specified regression specification. The pre-analysis plan
    referenced excluding treatment participants in a subsequent
    randomized vocational training program and cash grants program (the
    TVVP (2009-11) and SCY (2013-14) interventions, respectively -- see
    Figure A.1, "Primary School Deworming Project (PSDP) and Kenya Life
    Panel Survey (KLPS) Timeline"). It is these treatment group
    individuals (and their births) that are excluded from the analysis,
    with the control group upweighted to maintain the original
    representativeness. Schools in the cost-sharing intervention,
    administered in 2001 to a (random) subset within Group 1 and Group 2
    PSDP schools, are included in the analysis as pre-specified, along
    with an indicator for being in a cost-sharing school. Thus we
    believe this is consistent with the pre-specified analysis.

    -   *Manager's note: We shared this response with the second
        evaluator, and they removed this point from their report.*
