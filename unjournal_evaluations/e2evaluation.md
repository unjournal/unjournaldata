# Written report

## **Overall Assessment** {#overall-assessment}

The paper Money (Not) to Burn focuses on a very significant
environmental / health issue: crop residue burning in India, which
contributes to air pollution resulting in tens of thousands of deaths
each year. It does this by addressing whether the effectiveness of PES
schemes could be improved by paying a portion of the money upfront and
unconditionally. Addressing this issue is an important contribution to
the literature on PES.

## **1.** **Advancing our knowledge and practice**

The key contribution of the paper to PES' knowledge and practice is to
show that upfront payments can improve the effectiveness of PES by
promoting compliance in a way that appears to be cost effective. This is
very significant given that there is an ongoing debate whether PES
schemes can be effective in addressing environmental problems. The paper
would benefit from a clearer discussion of other PES research that has
dealt with issues of upfront payments, participants' trust of PES scheme
implementers, and financial constraints to the participation of poor
landholders in PES schemes.

The research is usefully carried out in the context of a developing
country where PES schemes have faced more practical implementation
challenges due to lack of funds/poverty among the land holders who are
the focus of the PES schemes.

## **2.** **Methods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness**

The methods used are well-justified and clearly explained. I find them
to be a reasonable approach to answering the questions considered by the
research. The methods are also usefully deployed to address two key
issues that are at the core of the implementation of PES in poorer
countries: i) lack of finance on the part of the land holders who are
asked to implement costly land management changes, and ii) to assess the
impact of land holders' trust that the PES payment will actually be
provided.

The mixed methods approach that integrates survey questionnaires,
statistical analysis and remote sensing analysis if well designed and
very useful in addressing the research questions.

The description of the methods should clarify how the overall amount of
the PES payment was set, given that this certainly has an impact on the
uptake of the contract as well as compliance with it.

## **3.** **Logic and communication**

The goals and questions of the paper are clearly expressed, and all the
concepts clearly defined and referenced.

The reasoning presents a very high degree of transparency, as defined by
[Open Philanthropy\'s
guide](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/).

The research is presented in a logical way, and the arguments written in
a way that is easy to follow.

The data and analysis is relevant to the arguments made.

Overall, the stated results and conclusions are consistent with the
evidence. However, the statement presented in the first paragraph of the
conclusion that the 'insight is not PES-specific and is likely relevant
for conditional cash transfer programs' is a speculation as there is no
information in the paper about cash transfer programs. The authors
should either provide evidence of relevance of the research to cash
transfer programs or delete the statement.

The following sentence in the conclusion (p. 16) also needs attention:
'Fourth, the need for upfront payments might fade over time as trust in
the program builds up.' If upfront payments are required also to address
financial constraints on the part of the participating landholders, as
stated by the authors, then it is not clear how the need for upfront
payments would fade. There would need to be an assessment of the
relative significance of trust and financial constraints to clearly
understand this issue.

The tables/graphs/diagrams are easy to understand in the context of the
narrative.

## **4.** **Open, collaborative, replicable science and methods**

### **4a. Replicability, reproducibility, data integrity** {#4a-replicability-reproducibility-data-integrity}

The method and its details are explained sufficiently to would enable
credible replication. However, I am not in a position to assess whether
the data is sufficiently accessible to allow easy replication.

### **4b. Consistency** {#4b-consistency}

The numbers in the paper make sense and they appear to be internally
consistent throughout the paper.

### **4c. Useful building blocks** {#4c-useful-building-blocks}

Data and results generated by the authors are likely to enable and
enhance future work and meta-analysis.

## **5. Engaging with real-world, impact quantification; practice, realism, and relevance**

As noted in the Overall assessment, the paper engages with a very
significant real-world environmental health problem, and the relevance
of its arguments, results and policy implications are clearly presented.

## **6. Relevance to Global Priorities**

The topic, approach, and discussion of the application of PES to
emissions for agricultural fires in India is certainly useful to global
priorities research and interventions related to the fields of PES,
environmental health, and greenhouse gas emissions.
