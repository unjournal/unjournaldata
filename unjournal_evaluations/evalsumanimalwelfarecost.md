# Evaluation summaries

## Romain Espinosa

Bruers (2023) emerged as a third concomitant proposal to economically
value animal welfare. The paper starts from the idea that animals, while
having preferences, cannot express willingness-to-pay (WTP) or
willingness-to-accept (WTA) related to changes that could affect their
welfare status. Policymakers and social planners thus lack appropriate
measures to estimate the welfare impact of a policy on animals (measures
that we could use in benefit-cost analyses for instance). To address
this problem, the author proposes to elicit humans' WTP/WTA to
experience an animal's life (focusing on farmed animals). He argues that
these outcomes reflect the external animal welfare costs, i.e., the
welfare burden imposed on animals, which is distinct from the altruistic
concerns that humans experience when they impact animals. In this setup,
a positive WTP to avoid experiencing an animal's life would reflect the
belief that a farmed animal's life is not worth living.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

This study explores animal welfare costs of meat consumption, using
stated preference methods from a sample of Belgians to elicit
willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) measures for
animal welfare. While the theoretical framework is robust and the
research attempts to mitigate several biases, the small sample size and
reliance on open-ended WTP elicitation limit reliability. The study
provides valuable insights into relative animal welfare costs and
consumer preferences, serving as a foundation for future research.

# Evaluation manager's discussion

*Note --- 4 Feb 2025: *The notes below are brief. We may to return to
provide further discussion. However, this may not be necessary, as the
evaluations and authors' responses include extensive context and
discussion.

## Why we chose this paper 

From our prioritization notes:

> Topic wise, this is a central question for policy.
>
> the core experiment seems a top innovation and with some potential to
> adopt more widely and potentially improve.
>
> \[Raisecd some questions about the methods and their interpretation\]

> Early rigorous example of quantifying animal welfare concerns in a way
> that can be practically applied.
>
> Further discussion of this paper could motivate people to do
> larger-scale survey-based work on this.

## Evaluation process/COI

The field of animal welfare economics is small. Both the evaluators and
relevant members of The Unjournal team have interacted with the author
in the past, e.g., in small conferences. There was some productive
back-and-forth discussion with the author, as seen in his responses.

[^6]: This paper significantly contributes to the discussion on animal
    welfare valuation by showing some limits of anthropocentric
    valuation including his own approach. The author recognizes that his
    method is not reliable to obtain accurate estimates of the welfare
    of animals. However, it makes a great contribution by underlining
    the numerous issues that make such approaches unreliable  (e.g., the
    perception of the animal's capacity to experience the world, the
    perception of the animal's farming conditions, hypothetical biases,
    outliers, and exclusion criteria).

    The work also contains numerous limitations, and most of them are
    recognized by the author himself. The main (and most standard)
    limitation is the hypothetical nature of the survey: participants do
    not face real incentives, which might lead to underestimating or
    overestimating the welfare burden of our diet imposed on animals.
    One of the most intrinsic limits concerns the difficulty for lay
    people (and humans in general) to project themselves into the lives
    of animals of other species. One can be indeed ignorant about the
    needs, the perception of the world, the cognition, etc. of other
    species, such that estimating their welfare is a daunting task. In
    addition, humans can also be ignorant about the rearing conditions
    in "conventional" farms, making the estimates even more uncertain.
    Ultimately, the layers of complexity (unusual survey, ignorance
    about other species, uncertainty about rearing conditions) add up
    and make the point estimates hard to rely on.

[^7]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^8]: The paper brings valuable insight into the broader research
    question of how to get monetary valuations of animal welfare using
    the tools and approaches of economics.

[^9]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^10]: Within the limits that the author himself recognizes, and with
    the exception of the cultured meat questions, the methods are valid,
    reasonable, and well-justified. From a theoretical perspective, the
    measure of the human's perception of the welfare of the animal is
    well defined: it corresponds to the change in private endowment that
    makes the human indifferent between living and not living the
    animal's life on top of his own life. From an empirical perspective,
    the author estimates it by considering several challenges, including
    (i) that some participants might have positive or negative
    perceptions of the welfare of the animal (i.e., the author uses a
    first-stage question to elicit the preferred pill), (ii) WTA/WTP
    framing might alter the results, (iii) outliers could lead to
    extremely high average WTP/WTA, (iv) some participants might have
    very low confidence in this unusual exercise, and (v) there might be
    some intrinsic (dis)utility in living an animal's life.

    The work also contains numerous limitations, and most of them are
    recognized by the author himself. The main (and most standard)
    limitation is the hypothetical nature of the survey: participants do
    not face real incentives, which might lead to underestimating or
    overestimating the welfare burden of our diet imposed on animals.
    One of the most intrinsic limits concerns the difficulty for lay
    people (and humans in general) to project themselves into the lives

    species, such that estimating their welfare is a daunting task. In
    addition, humans can also be ignorant about the rearing conditions
    in "conventional" farms, making the estimates even more uncertain.
    Ultimately, the layers of complexity (unusual survey, ignorance
    about other species, uncertainty about rearing conditions) add up
    and make the point estimates hard to rely on.

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: The paper is well-written and easy to understand both for
    academics and less-specialized readers.

[^13]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^14]: I did not find an online repository for data and code.

[^15]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^16]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^17]: Because the author recognizes that the method might not be
    reliable for empirical estimation, the usefulness might be limited
    for practitioners (other than to prevent them from replicating such
    approaches).

[^18]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^20]: The paper has a high relevance to global priorities given the
    prevalence of animal factory farming nowadays.
