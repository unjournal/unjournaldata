# Abstract [^1]

The study analyzes the effect of changes in migratory status on
entrepreneurship through a policy intervention that made Venezuelan
migrants in Colombia eligible for a resident visa. Causality is
established by using an extension of a regression discontinuity design.
The study found a positive effect on economic activity. However, it
might not be precise on the mechanisms that are driving the results (for
example, expanded access to credit, or subsidies?).

# Written report[^3]

## Main claim and overall assessment

The main claim of the paper is that improvements in legal rights for
immigrants can have a positive effect on entrepreneurship, measured as
the likelihood of registering a new firm. I consider that given the
economic method the authors use, an extension of a regression
discontinuity (RD), they can identify a causal effect of receiving a
visa on immigrant investment choices, and it gives a high internal
validity. The authors do not find any significant differences between
the treatment and control groups (Table 2), so receiving a visa is close
to a random experiment. To assess the external validity of the paper, it
might be important to understand the mechanism behind this effect. For
example, does obtaining a visa in Colombia give access to a range of
opportunities different than in other countries?

Overall, the paper tackles a highly important and relevant topic for
global priorities research, because migration flows have increased
during the last years. In particular, more than 7.7 \[million\]
Venezuelans have abandoned their country since 2018, putting pressure on
the countries that receive them, and Colombia is one of the main host
countries.[@nyc6wut5f21] Therefore, a better understanding of how to
promote socioeconomic integration is relevant for policy design.

## Summary

In this paper, the authors study a natural experiment in Colombia that
made nearly 500 thousand undocumented Venezuelan immigrants eligible for
a resident visa in 2019. The aim is to study the entrepreneurship
behavior of immigrants upon receiving this visa. The authors used the
*Registro Administrativo de Migrantes Venezolanos* (RAMV), a census of
Venezuelan immigrants, linked to the complete formal business registry,
*Registro Único Empresarial* (RUES).

The paper uses two empirical approaches: an extension of a regression
discontinuity (RD) design and a panel data approach. The RD extension
relies on the knowledge of how the running variable is constructed to
identify a source of random variation in running variable scores. They
then map this back to a probability that each observation lies above or
below each threshold. In this case, the design uses variation in the
running variable (coming from rain) to instrument for each person\'s
choice to apply for a visa. This application of this approach is a
contribution of the paper to the literature, and it offers an
econometric technique that can be applied to a broader set of questions.

On the other hand, the paper uses a panel format. This approach offers
an alternative approach to the RD strategy and allows the authors to
compare differences in business formation between the physical
relocation effect and the receipt of a legal residency permit (the visa
effect).

The main results suggest that immigrants who received a legal migratory
status increase their likelihood of registering a new firm by 1.2 to 1.
8 percentage points. The increase in economic activity is equivalent to
that of native Colombians four years after the visa was received. Also,
the effect of receiving a visa is over twice as large as the relocation
effect. Finally, the authors find evidence that the firms created by the
immigrants are a meaningful source of economic spillovers.

The paper contributes to our understanding of how legal rights can
change the investment choices of immigrants, as observed in their
entrepreneurship. Also, the paper contributes to the literature by
showing the application of an extension of a RD design.

## Major comments

1\. It would be interesting to delve into the mechanism behind the
results. The authors provide some discussion on page 9; however, they do
not provide any empirical evidence of the possible channels. For the
design of better migration policies, it is important to understand
\[which aspects of\] access to legal rights \[particularly\] allows
migrants \[to\] start a business. For example, credit possibilities,
subsidies, or a lower uncertainty because of the possibility of signing
contracts.

2\. According to the panel data approach and the results in Figure 6,
the statistically significant effect on firm creation happened until
2022, with a slight increase in 2021. So, what happened with these
immigrants between 2018 and 2021?

3\. It would be helpful to include in Tables 2 and 3 the number of
observations in each group.

4\. It would be nice to develop an analysis of the assets of the firm.
According to page 11, for all firms in the data, the authors obtained
the number of assets. This variable might provide useful information on
the type of firm created. Also, it might offer some proxy for firm
productivity.

5\. I \[would\] move the explanation that "Weather data was unavailable
for six municipalities" in footnote 25 before referring to Table A2.
Otherwise, it might be confusing why the sample size in Table A2 is
around 250 thousand.

6\. Is there any evidence of a network effect, such that people hired by
these firms are also Venezuelans? I am not sure if the data allows them
to study this, but it might be interesting to analyze.

7\. For future work, it could be relevant to analyze the life cycle of
these firms. Are they more likely to survive than firms of native
Colombians? Also, given the foreign nature of the entrepreneur, are
these firms more likely to become importers or exporters?

## Minor comments

1\. On page 17, it reads "In some settings, the mean value Xi can could
be interpreted." It should be removed the "can" or "could".

2\. Capitalize the first letter in footnote 21.

3\. When the authors explain notation in Equation 2, the index should be
k, not i.

4\. On Equation 4, should there be a coefficient next to the
ExpectedDelayi? Also, the error term should be eta, not epsilon.

5\. On page 28, it reads "The coefficient for ActualDelayi is positive
and \[...\]" However, it is negative (-0.0031).

6\. Sometimes the paper talks about "Columbia," it should be "Colombia"
(see for example page 23).
