# Abstract 

This is a very strong and interesting paper. More consideration of the
welfare impacts of nudges is to be welcomed, and there is clearly a gap
in the market for considering heterogeneous effects. However, there are
concerns about whether or not the experimental method is really designed
to answer questions of this type.

# Written report

As articulated by the authors of this paper, there has been a dramatic
rise in the use of behavioural insights based interventions, or nudges,
in the last decade or more, starting with governmental efforts in the
United Kingdom. Understanding the welfare effects of these 'nudges' is
valuable, insofar as it allows us to better understand the impacts of
the behavioural science movement more generally.

In general, I think the authors have set themselves a challenging task,
and have approached it in a defensible and sensible way. I do not feel
particularly well qualified to comment on the theoretical section of the
work, but there is nothing in this that seems prima facie problematic.

My comments on the remainder of the paper come under a small number of
headings. *Pedantry; Improvements on previous work; Samples and
Populations; Experiment Design and implications; Public Policy.*

## Pedantry

The term 'non-standard policy instruments (NPIs)' is not one that I'm
familiar with. It invokes Dellavigna (2009)'s
[@temp_id_5217500713752201] model of non-standard preferences, beliefs
and decision-making. I am not a fan. There are lots of interventions
(both behavioural and otherwise) that are non-standard instruments in
policy terms but are not nudges. This feels like overclaiming, although
I understand that the word nudge seems silly. I would like a clearer
understanding of the scope of this project.

## Improvements on previous work

Recent meta-analyses of the use of nudge, and considerations of the cost
effectiveness of nudges, have been conducted in a fairly blunt way,
considering, for example, whether nudges have, on average, positive
effects on their outcomes of interest. This is useful insofar as it
tells us whether, on average, behavioural interventions are making a
positive change, but it tells us little about the effectiveness of
individual nudges, and cannot be useful for forecasting. This is
therefore of fairly limited value. Assessments of cost effectiveness of
nudges similarly make use of fairly blunt tools in this consideration.
Implicit in this paper's consideration is that government interventions
rarely care about average effects on the population, but on particular
groups. In this sense, the effort to consider non-mean effects on
welfare is welcome.

There is also considerable attraction to a paper that seeks to consider
a small number (2) of examples, rather than trying to analytically 'boil
the ocean'.

## Samples and Populations

The paper's findings are reasonable on their own terms, and recognise
the value of looking at heterogeneity of effects. From the perspective
of a policymaker, it would be useful to consider the objective function
of policymakers in thinking about welfare improvements. For example,
policymakers might value welfare benefits for poor or disadvantaged
groups much more highly than richer people. Considering their welfare
effects is therefore paramount, and then these need weighting.

However, for many experiments, particularly field experiments where
budgets are constrained, the sample has already been narrowed down to a
group where the main question of interest is the average effect of the
intervention. For example, Burland et al
(2023)[@temp_id_5020268791452585], narrow down their study sample to
those participants who would most be of interest. Against this backdrop,
there needs to be decision-rules for when to consider heterogeneous
welfare impacts and when not to.

## Experiment Design and analysis

The experiments are well designed to answer their research questions,
and per the references in the paper itself, are mostly conducted in ways
that are similar to other published work. There is hence relatively
little value in nitpicking elements of the study design.

As such, I focus my review on those areas of the experimental design and
analysis that are particular to this paper, of which emerge as a
consequence of the intention of this paper in contrast to other papers
with similar experimental designs.

My first concern is about multiple comparisons, in particular when
thinking about heterogeneous treatment effects. Looking for
heterogeneous treatment effects involves in this case a large number of
potential comparisons compared to looking at mean effects. This seems
problematic, as given enough tests, some group for whom a positive
welfare effect can be found is likely to exist, but the effort of
finding this both reduces our confidence in these effects and in all
other tests. A rigorous approach to identifying heterogeneous effects
will require either a gateway (whereby we look for heterogeneity in the
face of a mean effect), which seems problematic given the paper's
arguments about the flaws in mean effects for assessing welfare; or much
larger sample sizes married to pre-registration of a priori hypotheses
about differential impacts.

My second concern is about what is being measured in the car experiment.
Participants' incentives are tied to their ability to approximate the
WTP of participants in another, hypothetical survey. As a result, this
is in effect a beauty contest in which participants are attempting to
approximate the preferences (biases et al), of other participants,
rather than necessarily expressing their own preferences.

Third, while the drink experiment is in theory incentive compatible, the
stakes are low - with a ⅕ chance of receiving a drink and paying for it.
Although for these experiments this is a reasonable method to elicit
preferences while minimising burden, low stakes is identified as an
identification problem for experiments like these and so the welfare
implications are likely to be miscalculated. This matters particularly
when we are considering heterogeneous effects, as it is another source
of noise.

## Public Policy

The authors propose a novel way of estimating welfare benefits for
Nudges or non-standard policy instruments, which evaluates heterogeneous
impacts for different groups of participants based on their
characteristics, or where on the distribution of prior beliefs they sit.
This is a valuable contribution to the way in which we estimate welfare
benefits of these kinds of interventions.

However, we should be cautious about holding low-cost, modest-impact
interventions like Nudges to a higher standard than that to which we
hold other, more 'standard' policy interventions. As with other recent
debates, like Chater and Loewenstein (2023)[@temp_id_7270071578014936],
the burden for success of nudge interventions, in terms of their
impacts, their legitimacy, and their welfare implications, is placed far
higher than for e.g. taxes of regulation.
