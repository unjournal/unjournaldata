# Abstract 

Strengths include excellent explanations of how the literature was
harmonized for comparison and how various analytical methods were
considered. Authors make compelling cases for both. The major
limitations are around the actual systematic review methodology that is
employed as well as the causal conclusions drawn. Authors have not used
published best-practices in the conduct of a systematic review, and have
not noted this as a limitation of the work. It will be critical to add
methodological limitations. There is also a lot of causal language used
that cannot be supported by the type of data presented (correlational),
thus the suggestion is to focus on the associations or relationships
between the IVs and DVs[^1], rather than speaking about \'effects\'.

# Summary Measures

# Written report

This review aims to examine the relationship between blood lead levels
and learning (including IQ as well as reading and mathematics). They
find that reducing blood lead levels by one natural log unit increases
cognitive outcomes by 0.12 standard deviations. Authors do a great job
of explaining how data was harmonized to allow for comparison across
studies, and in walking the reader through their analytical choices.
They also do a nice job of situating their work in the context of other
previous reviews. However, gold standard methodologies for conducting a
systematic review are not utilized, and the potential biases that this
introduces into the results are not acknowledged. There are also causal
claims that cannot be supported by the type of data used in this case.

*\[Managers' note: *we recognize that the paper also considers
instrumental-variables estimates, which have a case for a causal
interpretation under a particular set of conditions.\]

## Major comments

Results are given as one natural log unit increase in blood lead is
associated with X. It would be helpful to know, on average, what the
differences are in average blood lead levels for children in LICs vis a
vis MICs or HICs earlier in the intro (before you start getting into the
results).

Phrases like 'causal link', 'causal interpretation' and 'effect of lead
exposure' do not seem appropriate given the study designs. In other
places, more appropriate phrasing like 'association' and 'relationship'
are used. Phrasing should be tempered throughout the manuscript to
reflect that this is not causal evidence. Despite arguing the causal
link later in the manuscript, the data itself cannot make this claim,
particularly when there are so many comorbidities to lead exposure that
are also related to lower cognitive achievement (e.g., SES).

Authors need to acknowledge the search is not comprehensive. They state
that they seek to identify "all studies measuring the correlation
between blood levels and IQ or test scores", but then report that only
existing SRs and Google Scholar were searched.

Please provide details on whether there were exclusions based on
publication year or language.

On page 7, authors discuss that they include 286 estimates from 47
unique studies. It would be useful to know the minimum and maximum
number of estimates contributed by a single study.

In Figures 3 and 4, please add the number of estimates being averaged
for each study. It would also be useful to include the actual weighted
average effect of the RVE model when referring to it in the Figure note.
Finally, in Figure 4 there is a test of group differences presented
(whether blood levels had a different effect of reading versus math?).
It is unclear why this test was included or why such a difference would
be expected. There is also no discussion of the test of group
differences in text.

There needs to be a robust paragraph about the limitations of the
systematic review methodology employed here. Gold standard SR
methodology requires duplicate independent screening at full text to
reduce bias. It also requires that risk of bias assessments are
conducted in duplicate for each included study, and that results are
presented with reference to potential biases in the underlying
literature. It should also acknowledge whether limitations were put on
the publication year or language of the studies, and should acknowledge
that the search was not comprehensive (e.g., no grey literature sources
were mentioned).

Figure A3 should include the study citations. It is very surprising that
Taylor (2017)[@nwhm4rqutj5] would weaken the effect since it is a
non-significant study without a particularly high weight. It would great
if the authors could confirm this is indeed the correct study.

A PRISMA flow chart should be included to illustrate each phase of the
search process as well as the reasons for exclusion at full text.

It would be useful to have additional information in A1 and A2, e.g.,
sample size, age at lead testing, age at cognitive testing, what was the
measure used for cognitive testing (for reading and math).

## Minor comments

In the introduction, the second sentence of the first paragraph does not
follow logically from the first. You state that 600 million children in
L&MICs have elevated blood lead levels, and then you state that 3% of
this comes from HIC (which are not even mentioned in the first
sentence). Do you mean that 3% comes from middle-income countries?

I am not sure who the target audience is, but when sigma is first used
in the text (on page one of the intro) it may be useful to explain that
this is the symbol for standard deviation.

On p. 31, in the first full sentence, please add the unit of measurement
for the 149 and 15 numbers.
