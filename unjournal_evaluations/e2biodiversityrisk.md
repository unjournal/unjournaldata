# Abstract 

This paper seeks to measure biodiversity risk. It does so in several
ways:\
\
- Via a news based measure \
- textual analysis of corporate disclosures \
- a survey of finance professionals, regulators and academics \
\
The authors then apply their measures in an asset pricing and portfolio
context and find that markets are pricing biodiversity risk to some
degree but their survey respondents believe that market pricing of
biodiversity risk is incomplete. 

# Summary Measures

We asked evaluators to give some overall assessments, in addition to
ratings across a range of criteria. *See the *[*evaluation summary
"metrics"*](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumbiodiversityrisk#metrics "null")*
for a more detailed breakdown of this. See these ratings in the context
of all Unjournal ratings, with some analysis, in our *[*data

**Overall assessment: **We asked evaluators to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **"On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in? (See

# Written report

As might be expected from this prominent team, this is extremely well
executed research within the confines of what counts as research within
the finance discipline. I believe, however, there is a better but harder
way to go which involves much more interdisciplinary research and using
actual measures of biodiversity loss as opposed to measures that are
largely extracted from either news or expert opinion, with experts
largely being members of the finance industry or academic finance
researchers. 

What surprises me the most, is that in this attempt to measure
biodiversity risk there has been no deep reflection on potential
measurement validity issues that could arise from this exercise and
perhaps learning from the many lessons that are emerging from trying to
measure ESG risks generally and climate risk in particular. From Berg at
al. (2022, Review of Finance)[@nq5nigpc3pp] we know that such top-down
aggregate measures are very problematic. Nguyen et al. (2023, PLOS
Climate)[@n1go7sh6lb7] highlights that even in the case of climate
transition risk[^2] scope 3 emissions there is very high divergence
between measures from different data providers. 

All this should make us very cautious about aggregate measures in the
biodiversity context given how multifaceted it is and how complex
measurement is. There are what I would call "internal" attempts to
validate the measures that the authors have developed relative to other
measures they developed. However, none of these really provide a test of
external validity and all the measures could be subject to some degree
of impression management or fad, as opposed to measuring actual
biodiversity risk.

## Other comments:

-   It feels like the paper is perhaps doing too much and is perhaps
    more than one paper. I think purely focusing on measurement is a
    task big enough for one paper. Doing measurement and really nailing
    some form of external validity based on actual biodiversity measures
    would be a paper in its own right that could perhaps more strongly
    validate the aggregate measures that the authors have developed.

-   As we know from the climate context, transition risk[^3] and
    physical risk[^4] are very different and have very different
    measures and impacts. I would encourage the authors to think more
    deeply about this distinction between physical and transition risks
    in the biodiversity risk and develop the related discussion in the
    paper (which was light). In this context, the pricing and portfolio
    analyses seem premature.

-   Page 4 and page 13 - the sectors that are identified as having high
    biodiversity risk are not the ones commonly characterised as having
    biodiversity risk[^5]. Despite the author\'s best effort to convince
    us that this is not a not another proxy for climate risk, the
    sectors look suspiciously like climate sectors. The statement on
    page 13 that the energy sector uses a lot of land is patently
    untrue.

-   In a related point to the above, the authors undertake a correlation
    of climate and biodiversity measures from the data on Figure 3.
    However, it seems clear to me that there is a long-term trend
    between the measures that is not captured by the higher frequency
    correlations undertaken by the authors. Perhaps a cointegration test
    might be revealing in this context.

-   I did not see mention of the authors obtaining ethical approval to
    do the survey, perhaps I missed it.

\
Overall, this is an interesting paper and I suspect the measures that
the authors develop will ultimately be widely used. They will lead to a 
greater focus in the area of biodiversity risk and future research will
further refine these measures. However, I suspect that true measurement
and true progress will come from bottom-up approaches that distinguish
transition, physical and liability risk in the context and where actual
physical measures of biodiversity risk are used.
