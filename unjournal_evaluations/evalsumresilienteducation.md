# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Building Resilient
Education Systems: Evidence from Large-Scale Randomized Trials in Five
Countries\"[@10.3386/w31208
]. To read these evaluations, please see the links below.

**Evaluations**

1\. [Anonymous evaluation
1](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e1resilienteducation/draft?access=73w1ggr5 "null")

2\. [Anonymous evaluation
2](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e2resilienteducation/draft?access=nelzehal "null")

**Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

The paper studies an important question \[surrounding the\]
effectiveness of low-cost education programs which could reduce learning
losses faced by primary \[school\] students due to shocks or emergencies
in five developing countries.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

Provides important evidence on \[the\] effectiveness of a low-tech
intervention to stem learning losses from school closures (likely to
increase in coming years) by scaling it up vertically & across diverse
geographies

Note that \[the\] results only apply to numeracy skills and for
temporary and abrupt school closures. Future work should see if it is
effective for other skills & circumstances (displaced people, girls),
and if contextualizing content/methods improves outcomes.

# Evaluation manager's discussion

We sought two evaluations of this well-regarded paper, which has since
received the 2024 [ADB-IEA Innovative Policy Research
Award](https://events.development.asia/learning-events/winners-2024-adb-iea-innovative-policy-research-award "null").
This paper provides evidence on remote instruction during the COVID-19
pandemic. The authors conducted several powered RCTs in India, Kenya,
Nepal, The Philippines, and Uganda. They find that delivering tutorials
over the phone can stem learning loss. The authors also provide valuable
evidence on the *setting* within which remote teaching/learning may be
most effective; they find no major difference between NGO-provided
tutorials and government-provided ones (if anything, the latter do
better, assuaging fears about scalability within government
systems).[^24] (The 'null effect' is not tight. The point estimates for
the government-provided tutorials is substantially larger than for NGOs
(0.315 SDs vs 0.263 SDs) with standard errors of about 0.05 SDs for
each, suggesting fairly wide confidence intervals for each.)[^25]

The two evaluators were asked specifically to comment on the design of
the RCTs, the claims, and the policy considerations arising from the
paper.

Evaluator 1 mentions that more details are needed on the design of the
phone tutorials to be able to fully understand the impacts it might
have, and to understand whether the efficacy of the tutorials might be
undermined by shared phone ownership or similar constraints that
low-income households in developing countries typically operate in. They
also suggested a closer look at channels (explanations for the results
obtained) related to health (given the pandemic) and via greater
attention from caregivers. The authors would do well to consider these.

The second evaluation provides a more detailed and careful look at the
claims as well as the policy implications. They make specific
suggestions for authors to provide more details of the SMS-only
intervention (again, likely helpful for scaling or translating this
evidence into other contexts), as well as some contextual factors
related to the delivery of the intervention. They also mention several
issues related to the *scaling* of this intervention.

A key consideration here: if many individuals in a household are sharing
a phone this could impede efficient delivery. If this was the case for a
majority of households in this trial, this could be seen as an
underestimate of the impact of an intervention in a context where
everyone had (or was provided with) their own phone.

Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of
how to scale education interventions in emergency settings, especially
in low-resource contexts.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: The quality of the paper is very high. The contribution of the
    project, the credibility of the methods used to study causality, its
    impact on real world issues. Furthermore, the cost effectiveness
    nature of the intervention makes it very useful.

[^6]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\

    This was on the newer form only

[^7]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^8]: Please see my comments above.

[^9]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^10]: Overall, I liked the simplicity of the RCT design and it was
    cleanly executed. The main results are presented in an interesting
    manner. My concerns are with the robustness checks and mechanisms. I
    have pointed out the same above.

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: The logical flow in the data analysis is consistent with the
    arguments set forth by the authors. There is some repetition of
    content in Sections III B and C (already covered in the
    Introduction) which can be avoided.

[^13]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^14]: Manager's note: This evaluators' response (in the comment)
    suggests that they may have been interpreting this criteria
    differently than we intended.

[^15]: Replicability in a RCT is always a tricky point. The RCT seems to
    be a costly matter however the intervention is very cost-effective.
    Plus the authors were able to reduce the costs further from the
    Botswana study due to economies of scale. From a perspective of
    cost, I would say the RCT is not very replicable. However, with
    reference to discussion on methods and data analysis, the authors
    have done a good job. The tables and figures are labelled properly
    and explained well. They are easily replicable.

    Managers' note: This does not fully capture our intentions when we
    asked about replicability (and openness, and data sharing). We did
    not want this to consider the costs of running a new RCT, which is
    largely out of the researchers' control. We will work on explaining
    this criteria better in future.\

[^16]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^17]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^18]: Yes, the research question being of utmost importance and
    relevant to deal with the education crisis, I would say the paper
    and the suggested intervention could be relevant to practitioners.

[^19]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^20]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\

    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^21]: The paper deals with a global priority: learning loss due to
    emergenies. The intervention of using phone tutorials with SMS
    reminders is a cost-effective method which could have high impact on
    primary education learning in developing countries.

[^22]: The paper studies an important question of effectiveness of low
    cost education programs which could reduce learning losses faced by
    primary students due to shocks or emergencies in 5 developing
    countries. Given the nature of the question and the effectiveness of
    the intervention, I think it should be placed in a top tier journal.

[^23]: In continuation with my previous point, the importance of the
    question makes it one of the recent interesting topics in economics
    research. Additionally, since the low cost intervention has
    effectively been scaled across 5 countries, I think the study has
    made a unique contribution by contributing to the external validity
    of education in emergencies research.

[^24]: Footnote: In previous related contexts, when programs were passed
    from NGO trials to government implementation, the program
    effectiveness waned.

[^25]: Government Teachers: The impact of phone calls and SMS messages
    delivered by government teachers was a 0.314 standard deviation
    improvement in learning. Based on a simple normal approximation, the
    80% CI for this effect is (0.248, 0.380). NGO Teacher Aides: The
    impact of phone calls and SMS messages delivered by NGO teacher
    aides was a 0.263 standard deviation improvement in learning. Again
    a normal distribution suggests an 80% CI for this effect of (0.206,
    0.320).
