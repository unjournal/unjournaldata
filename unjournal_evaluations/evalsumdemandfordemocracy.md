# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: "Misperceptions and Demand
for Democracy under Authoritarianism"[@nrf4bv40dcp]. This research
involved ambitious field (and online) experiments into the impact of
providing information on "the status and implications of democracy and
media freedom on actual beliefs and voting patterns in Türkiye",
yielding encouraging, actionable results. Both evaluations are strongly
positive about the research contribution and overall rigor. Both offer
substantive suggestions (as does the evaluation manager Bob Kubinec,
below). Evaluator 1 (Korhan Kocak) raised some concerns with the use of
post-treatment values as outcomes given ex-ante group differences. They
also requested a "robust discussion of the studies' ethics". The second
(anonymous) evaluator raised concerns about the reliability of the V-Dem
indicators data; about the construct validity -- mismanagement and
corruption vs. democracy and freedom; and about interpreting the
estimates given substantial heterogeneity in compliance. To read these
evaluations, please see the links below.

# Evaluation summaries

## Korhan Kocak

Why authoritarian leaders continue to receive support despite openly
agitating against democratic institutions is one of the most important
puzzles of the last few decades. This paper argues that the answer is
partly lack of knowledge about the costs of authoritarianism. Using an
online and a field experiment, the authors show that informational
treatments that remedy this lack of knowledge can have substantial
effects on both beliefs and voting behavior.

## Anonymous Evaluator 2 

This paper makes a valuable contribution to research on authoritarianism
and democratic resilience by combining an online survey and a
large-scale field experiment in Turkey to test whether correcting
factual misperceptions about institutional decline can shift political
attitudes and electoral behavior. \
\
The study is theoretically ambitious, well-powered, and methodologically
transparent, with the field experiment demonstrating real-world
behavioral effects on opposition vote share. The paper could be improved
by addressing the mismatch between the authors' normative framing of
democracy and media freedom and the more instrumental, performance-based
content of their treatments. The authors could also do more to address
concerns about treatment spillover and compliance heterogeneity in the
field experiment. \
\
Overall, the study is rigorous and policy-relevant, and it offers a
strong foundation for future work on information-based interventions in
hybrid regimes.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

It is a pleasure to write a summary for the ambitious new working paper
on misinformation in elections under authoritarianism by Acemoglu et al
[@Acemoglu2024Misperceptions]. As our evaluators noted, the research
design was robust, creative, and implemented during a critical period in
Turkish politics. Employing both an online survey experiment and a
confederate field experiment with actual Turkish political parties, the
authors were able to test for the effect of their messages about the
state of Turkish political institutions on a wide array of attitudes and
electoral behavior. In short, the intervention worked, both in terms of
changing Turkish voters' perceptions of Turkish democracy and even their
choice in the ballot box. As the authors report, the opposition vote
share experienced a remarkable +0.8pp vote share increase at the
neighborhood/precinct level, and when the proportion treated is taken
into account, is perhaps even higher at approximately +2pp (2SLS
estimates in the appendix). Given that the treatment was purely
informational--it did not involve longer-term contact or focus
groups---this is a truly remarkable result.

Political scientists have long theorized that control over information
plays a critical role in sustaining and enabling authoritarian
government. Especially in a world in which people almost always report a
preference for democracy, for a regime to maintain a monopoly on
competition, it needs to justify restrictions on democratic practice
through misdirection of some sort. However, while we have excellent
theoretical treatments [@Little2022Motivated][@Little2017Propaganda],
and careful on-the-ground field research [@Letsa2025autocratic], it is
very tricky to directly manipulate the information people receive---in
part because only people who are already *opposed* to the authoritarian
regime are interested in hearing counter-regime messaging
[@Batista2022Fake].

For example, Metaketa I, arguably the most ambitious effort to test the
effect of information provision to voters by running the same study in
five countries, found a treatment effect of almost perfectly zero for
information provided to voters about incumbent performance
[@Dunning2019Information].[^21] In an even more ominous study,
[@Cheeseman2021Curse] found that an anti-corruption message
*encouraged*, rather than discouraged, a preference among voters for
tolerating corrupt politicians. The problem, of course, is that much can
be lost between the transmission of information and its reception.
Especially in a political context, people are naturally suspicious of
freely-provided information as it is hard to be truly non-partisan when
information may hurt or help one political side.

For these reasons, the evaluators--and myself--are thrilled to see some
strong and positive effects of information about Turkey's democratic
decline on support for authoritarianism. Furthermore, we know that these
effects are concentrated among people who were government supporters
whether in the online experiment (Figure A-10) or in the field
experiment (Figure 7). These are the type of heterogeneous relationships
that we would want to see if the information theory of authoritarian
government is true. If authoritarian leaders like Turkish President
Tayyip Erdogan are successfully manipulating the information environment
to secure support, then an intervention that provides credible
information about the health of democracy should have a stronger effect
on people who were more receptive to Erdogan's messages.

This is certainly good news, but of course we need to frame this result
within our broader context of scientific knowledge. At The Unjournal, we
particularly want to know whether interventions will travel well to new
situations. In this case, it will be difficult to know for sure. The
reason is, as Evaluator 2 notes, that there are a lot of different
attributes both of the treatment and the political environment that are
relatively unique. Figure A-3 shows what the pamphlets that were
distributed with political parties looked like, which as Evaluator 2
points out, represent specific information about "media neutrality and
independence." While media freedom is a core part of democracy, there
are of course many other attributes of democracy the research team could
have emphasized. The authors of the study also used an impartiality
framing in which they tried to emphasize the scientific nature of their
information about media quality, which was drawn from the [Varieties of
Democracy](https://www.v-dem.net/) project. It could be that this
scientific framing is what gave the intervention so much efficacy---but
we would not be able to know this without further testing.

Second, it is important to emphasize that the effect of the treatment is
conditional on aspects both of the general political environment and
specific local institutions. While Turkey has become quite authoritarian
in recent years, it still has a relatively healthy civil society and
level of political debate compared to say the United Arab Emirates or
China. Furthermore, President Erdogan was seen as uniquely vulnerable
after more than a decade in office and a declining economy, which may
have made his voters more receptive to messages criticizing him. As
Evaluator 1 mentioned regarding so-called "spillover" effects, even the
electoral geography can affect the treatment efficacy depending on the
distribution of government vs. opposition supporters in particular
neighborhoods.

For these reasons, we urge the authors to consider doing more work to
theorize as to what it was that made their intervention so successful,
especially when compared to other experimental attempts that were
unsuccessful. Isolating different components of the treatment and
understanding how they affect voter perceptions is crucial for building
foundational knowledge in this field and designing interventions for
real-world use.

In addition, it is important to note that there are a number of
statistical choices that have to be made when analyzing what is a fairly
complex experiment. Our evaluators pointed out that they could consider
alternative strategies for estimating the treatment effect of the field
experiment, whether examining the complier-average causal effect (CACE)
from evaluator 2 or "persuasion effects" from evaluator 1.
Understandably, there are a number of possible statistical analyses that
could be done with this data, and we do encourage the authors to pursue
alternative estimands so we can maximize what we can learn from this
study.

I would add to this discussion that it is important to note that the
field experiment's power depends strongly on including the value of the
prior election in the regression analyses. In Table 2 columns 1-2, the
standard error declines by half when the prior election result is
included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) estimate for the field
experiment. Without including it, the estimate is too noisy to be
considered "statistically significant." This particular issue should not
be considered a major limitation, however, as conditioning on the prior
value of the outcome is considered best practice when analyzing
experiments.

At the same time, it is important to note that the field experiment is
necessarily more limited in terms of power than the online experiment,
which has a massive treatment size of over 4,000 subjects. For these
reasons, it may be difficult to perform more complicated re-analysis of
the field experiment results such as spatial analysis as evaluator 1
recommends. Given that the treatment effects are relatively consistent
across different types of elections, though, it would appear that the
field experiment effect is fairly robust even given the limitations in
power. The authors might consider using the (ordered) beta regression
estimator to maximize power given that the outcome is bounded and thus
non-linear [@Smithson2006better][@Kubinec2022Ordered].

# Unjournal process notes  

***Note on versions (see footnote)***[^22]

## How we chose the evaluators

We looked for evaluators with expertise and research experience
involving political economy, electoral behavior, misperceptions and
information, experiments (online and field), and causal inference
econometrics, as well as familiarity with the field context. Although it
was challenging to find researchers with this expertise who had not
worked with the authors (especially given Acemoglu's prolificity),
evaluator reported a conflict of interest.

## Author engagement

The authors were aware of our this evaluation and kept us up-to-date on
the most recent versions of their work. We invited them to provide a
reply, but Ceren Baysan noted "I\'m unsure when we\'d be able to write a
response." As always, if they are able to provide a response, we will
integrate it into this package.

[^18]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^19]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^20]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\

[^22]: *W*e had some miscommunication with the evaluators, and they each
    seem to have considered the October 2024 version, at least in part,
    instead of the March 2025 version. We followed up with both
    evaluators, highlighting some of the things that had changed between
    the versions, although the differences were not generally major.
    Other than updating the precise numbers referred to, the evaluators
    declined to update their reports. One of the evaluators noted "I
    don\'t think these changes substantively impact the rest of my
    comments." Our own take is the same: the updates do not
    substantially interact with the evaluations.
