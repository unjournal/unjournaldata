# Abstract 

We prioritized the paper "Effects of Emigration on Rural Labor
Markets"[@nix0rkbas50] because of its potential relevance to the
decision to shut down the charity "No Lean Season". Although we normally
seek two or more strong evaluations, we struggled to find evaluators for
this paper. We would have persisted further, but we were also advised
that other work in this area seems more relevant (see discussion below).
Thus we decided to release this package with only a single evaluation.

## **Evaluation**

1.  [Frank Gyimah Sackey's
    evaluation](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/eval1emigrationonlabor "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^1]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").)
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best.*

# Evaluation summary

## Frank Gyimah Sackey[^4]

The paper sought to examine the effects of emigration on rural labour
markets, specifically, how outmigration transforms rural labour markets
\[using an experiment involving a transport subsidy intervention\].
Using a sample of 5,792 potential seasonal migrants across 133 villages,
the authors observed that transport subsidies increased beneficiaries'
income \[and this\] generated spillover effects. The research findings
indicate that the transport subsidies increase beneficiaries' income due
to better employment opportunities and also generated some spillovers
\[These included\] increasing individual take-up rate as a result of a
higher density offers which induces those connected to the offered
recipients to also migrate, the village emigration rate increases,
increase in the male agriculture wage rate in the village increasing
income earned in the village. \[...\]There is a decrease in the price of
non-tradeables such as prepared food and tea while net food prices
increase. The paper contributes immensely to the research on migration
and labour studies. It also provides practical insights on intervention
and adds useful value to research on interventions and has policy
implications. The immense contribution is attributed to policy
implications of the effects of subsidies on intervention and how the
impact positively on such interventions. The practical insight is
demonstrated by how recipients receive such interventions when they are
directly involved and whatever benefits such as the subsidies go to them
directly to achieve the desired results.

# Evaluation manager's discussion 

Evidence Action shut down the charity No Lean Season (the precise
intervention in this paper) partly because of \"Mixed evidence of
impact\" (see [GiveWell\'s report
here](https://blog.givewell.org/2019/06/06/evidence-action-is-shutting-down-no-lean-season/#2017Study "null")).  But
the decision was also partly due to particular problems (allegations of
fraud and mismanagement by the implementing partner. Thus, we suspected
there may still be a strong case that this could be a cost-effective
intervention. The present paper reported substantial positive effects,
and was heavily cited. Thus we believed it deserved more careful
evaluation, and if there were substantial flaws, these should be
publicly shared. 

Although we normally seek two or more strong evaluations, we struggled
to find evaluators who could provide informed constructive criticism and
appraisal. We might have persisted further, however...

After further consultation with an applied researcher in this area, we
were advised that the GiveWell's decision was more about issues having
to do with the failure of the program to *scale up, *rather than its
earlier performance as considered in the paper evaluated here. Follow-on
work thus seems more relevant for further evaluation, such as
"Delegation Risk and Implementation at Scale: Evidence from a Migration
Loan Program in Bangladesh" (Mitchell et al, 2023)
[@mitchell2023delegation]. [^20]

# Author engagement

On June 26 2024 the authors let us know they are working on a revised
version of the present paper, and hope to respond to the current
evaluation when the revised version is released. We may revisit this
work at that point, with potential for further evaluation.

    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^10]: Though the author found no usefulness in determining whether the
    migration experience of those travelling from high intensity village
    is more successful than those from low intensity village between
    migrants and non-migrants, this could have been observed with
    migrants alone.

[^11]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^12]: The author also could have examined differences in individual
    endowments among the migrants and non-migrants as the willingness to
    migrate may be determined by individual characteristics and not the
    transport subsidy alone. Again, comparison between those who are
    offered subsidies and those who were not should have included
    decomposition and counterfactual analysis as well as measuring the
    wage gap among them to critically examine the push factors apart
    from using the transport subsidy as a sole factor.

[^13]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^14]: The sources of the data are clear, while the analyses are well
    explained with clear labelling. Replicating the analysis is
    possible, however, the modeling and the analysis is so broad that
    one might lose focus, in relation to the objectives.

[^15]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^16]: The paper is very relevant to the real-world situation while its
    policy implications are consistent and implementable. Though the
    set-up assumptions are valid, the literature review leading to the
    assumptions should have had the Harris-Todaro theory and model on
    rural migration was adequately reviewed with its assumptions to add
    more insights to the set-up assumptions. Again, the analysis,
    especially, regarding the result tables were too many that the
    average audience my lose focus. Though some of the tables have been
    placed as an appendix there is the need to streamline and summarize
    the models and the tables in a brief but in a parsimonious manner in
    order to lose important results.

[^17]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^18]: Though the topic is clearly explained, useful to the global
    audience and has high impact interventions, the author may consider
    using the word \"Impact\" instead of \"Effects.\"
