  This paper's most important contribution is the evidence for sustained
  positive impacts on mental health after 5 years (one of the longest
  follow-ups in the field), after short, lower-cost (community based)
  therapy. As critical comments, I don\'t believe the \'depressive
  realism\' task was well selected, I see opportunities to better
  contextualize the effects for the reader as well as opportunities to
  improve figures and make stronger policy recommendations.

# Written report

***Manager's note: ****We added the emphasis (bold text) below*

1.  **Main contributions**

This work has many strengths, including:

-   Evidence for positive impacts on mental health following therapy 4-5
    years later, one of the **longest follow-ups in the field**

-   Consideration of wider outcomes, including nulls for economic
    outcomes - sheds important light on \[the\] **limits of what therapy
    cannot do**

-   **Very valuable to see low-cost and relatively short-duration
    therapeutic approaches be effective in the long run** - the fact
    that these interventions were community/ peer-delivered is great
    both in terms of cost savings but also in terms of community
    empowerment

-   The collection of experts' opinions is not often seen and I think
    nicely complements the surprising, positive nature of results[^2]

The two main policy-relevant findings are **(1) that therapy has
sustained positive effects in the long run**, thus highlighting therapy
as relevant for future global health prioritization**, **and **(2) that
therapy can be delivered in lower-cost and shorter durations** that are
impactful**.** There is existing evidence on the second point, so this
triangulation is welcome to see in shaping a robust body of evidence. On
point one, future replication will be needed to better understand these
effects, but this is a promising result in an overall well done study.

2.  **Critical points**

-   One of the main results is that, after pooling the 2 trials, the
    **treatment groups had 0.15 SDs lower PHQ-9 scores relative to the
    control**,[^3] at a p = 0.08. **This is the result I'm least
    confident in and most interested in seeing replicated.** While p
    \<.1 is a convention for significance in economics, it is not in
    many medical and epidemiological fields, and I too prefer a more
    conservative cutoff \<.05, especially for novel or surprising
    effects. Importantly, recent large-scale robustness replications of
    work published in top journals suggests effects at the p \>.05 but
    \<.1 level were least likely to replicate and effect sizes would
    frequently diminish very \[notably\] (approximately halve I believe;
    see Brodeur et al. 2024)[@nddshx2k6y0]

-   Decomposition of PHQ: good to see this. Sometimes in practice
    specific symptoms are measures with singular or very few items,
    making these less robust measures overall. It's hard to get a sense
    of how robust each measure was from the current write-up.

-   Measure of mental health: **would have been better in my opinion to
    survey a wider battery of mental health measures, rather than just
    depression**, especially since this is the focal point of the paper.
    In some ways I think **the language of the paper may overstate
    benefits and under-specify their domain**, we're really looking at
    depression and most likely targeting behavior and mood here. I
    appreciate the difficulty of administering many measures in LMICs
    especially, but there are now good and validated and even short
    measures that can further capture broader mental health measures.
    (e.g. GAD-2 or 7).

-   Would be nice to see Cronbach's alphas or similar for PHQ-9.

-   Very brief mention on **missing data** - could this be reported more
    clearly, how much data was missing, was it at random, which measures
    were affected, was any of it at high degrees? Something like
    Little's MCAR could be a quick start here.

-   With some uncertainty, but it seems to be that **baseline mental
    health might have mattered**, considering HAP adults had moderately
    severe depression whereas the THPP participants had 'lower
    (moderate)' depression. This might be interesting to unpack, as
    recent interventions have found no heterogeneity based on baseline
    symptomatology (Barker et al. 2022)[@n9ppb12cx1v], but other
    meta-analytic work has suggested that interventions seem to be more
    effective when baseline problems (Bower et al., 2013)[@np22x9mfbiw]

-   It was very interesting to read the discussion around the THPP and
    lack of stronger effects, particularly around high rates of
    spontaneous recovery. I wonder if more specific measures for
    postpartum depression at pre- and post- would help in the future.

-   On the note of population characteristics, I imagine the authors
    would be underpowered to test for gender differences given women are
    more widely surveyed across two interventions. This should be a
    target for future work, as well as capturing a more general
    population. As above, pregnancy is associated with particular
    patterns of mental health risk and recovery that make generalization
    difficult.

-   I found it difficult to get a sense of population characteristics
    beyond what is in the tables, which was brief - e.g. a sense of
    income?

-   Overall, I think the **findings need to be better contextualized**.
    The authors define them as 'substantial' but what does that really
    mean? A few ideas to make this clearer to readers could be:

    -   The classic epidemiological argument that at population level
        this matters a lot (Rose 2001)[@n3ph6cjeab0]

    -   Reference and directly compare effects targeted by other
        comparable interventions, perhaps such as behavioral change -
        e.g. around substance misuse, sexual risk, bullying etc.,
        preferably in the long run; and then also around other primarily
        general-health-focused interventions such as e.g. obesity, ADHD.
        There are many systematic reviews on these topics and my reading
        is that mental health interventions are as tractable and
        comparable/ not too far behind to general physical health
        interventions. This might not be clear to a reader or someone in
        policy, the latter of whom might be facing difficult decisions
        on triage and funding prioritization.

-   Further on the population-level point: I would have loved to have
    seen a stronger conclusion based on the evidence on how we should
    address **the inverse care problem**. Therapy may seem \[to be\] an
    individual-level approach to health, but when scaled to a
    governmental health system, it will be more impactful, and that's
    where effort should go. See further Chater & Loewenstein
    2023[@nwptaqzza9w] on why individual-level framed interventions and
    recommendations misdirect funding.

-   More detail on **why pooling the two trials is appropriate** and
    what limitations that may have would be welcome for readers without
    a clinical background. The shared treatment approach allows this,
    but the very different populations examined jointly could be a
    difficulty for precision in interpretation and understanding
    mechanisms. For instance, the authors' broad level interpretation is
    that HAP drives the overall effects but certainly someone could say
    it's population dependent, e.g. not being pregnant that contributes
    or matters more than the intervention.

-   A little bit more on why behavioral activation matters would be
    good. For instance, it is not clear from the current writeup why
    treatment primarily targeting behavior and then affecting mood would
    be expected to change different types of cognitive outcomes,
    including some of the examined ones.

-   If tasks were financially incentivized, was it clear (any formal
    test?) which was linked to receiving or not the financial payment?
    From past experience in global health, instructions around payment
    in the context of experiments can be very hard to understand for
    participants.

-   A few points on the bead bracelet making task. Overall, I don't
    think this is a suitable task for testing for depressive realism,
    though it is an interesting way of showcasing the Dunning-Kruger
    effect. These points are relatively more minor, as I don't see this
    as the main focus of the paper, and indeed the authors do not frame
    it as such. This is also a controversial literature, where many of
    us have different views, though there is a building consensus from
    reviews that if there is such an effect, it is likely more
    constrained to certain circumstances and domains rather than
    universal.

    -   Deficits in self-perception, negative views of self, rumination
        are fairly established for depressed individuals.

    -   Tasks should not be self-relevant if we want to isolate the
        effects of such deficits from perception about others or the
        environment.

    -   Tasks where there is no clear standard for reality, such as
        relative positioning to others, are a weak benchmark (Moore &
        Fresco, 2012[@nv458873nhl] - see this review on this point and
        further critical points)

    -   If participants were informed they could get a job later
        reporting overconfidence is not illogical - how was this
        accounted for?
