Evaluators were asked to follow the general guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators).

They were also provided with [these additional resources specific to
this
paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vuB9GtmuqCB3O92t3ccmXzh4qNDEua-hsLBdr67G0ho/edit#heading=h.skg5o7h1vzxe),
rationale for its selection, and an 'editorial' first pass of aspects of
the paper to consider. *Note: the third evaluator was asked to focus
specifically on the empirical exercise in the paper.\*\*(See below)*

If you (the authors) would like to respond to the evaluations, please do
so in a separate file rather than adding comments on this document. You
are welcome to use any format you like. If you prefer, you may
'duplicate' all or part of this document and intersperse your comments
with the written evaluations. Where you respond to specific points from
an evaluation, please make this clear (e.g. include the text you are
responding to in quotes above your response). You are also welcome to
provide a more general response to the evaluations.

After we get your response (or if we don't hear from you, in two weeks)
the entire evaluation process (original evaluations, ratings and

include a brief \'editorial\' synthesis. This will be posted in our
[curated Sciety group](https://sciety.org/groups/the-unjournal/about) as
well as in hypothes.is linked to the hosted research (and we also seek
to obtain DOIs for each evaluation and response).

Although we are explicitly sharing the evaluators' names with you at
this point, all 3 evaluators agreed to sign their evaluations. We will
include their names along with the published evaluations.

# Evaluation 1

## Written report

Advance Market Commitments (AMCs) are a promising and already burgeoning
area for global health aid for new vaccines and therapies, and have been
widely used and discussed in the short time since their initial
proposal. They also have been suggested as promising to speed up
response for urgent needs during an emerging disease pandemic, making
them potentially relevant for reducing global catastrophic biorisk.

This paper reviews recent uses and theory about AMCs, and in addition to
a more general review, it seems useful to consider some of the claims
more critically, and then to consider the relevance for key global
priorities. I therefore begin with a review of the contents and claims,
including a critique, then discusses relevance to global health and to
pandemic preparedness and response.

As an overview of Advanced Market Commitments, the paper is excellent.
It addresses many key points about the theoretical economic
justification, provides data on the brief but very successful history of
AMC usage in the past 2 decades, and the issues with the design which
have been identified and are still relevant. The last section,
especially the discussion of distant technological targets, has a number
of implications, however, which are not fully explored - and which are
critical to applications of the paper.

In both the initial theoretical section and the final section, the paper
discusses use of AMCs for theoretically distant targets. The issues with
doing this are discussed, however, the scope of the paper means that
alternative approaches are not explored. They note that AMCs are
intended to "supplement, not replace, direct R&D support."

To discuss why the limitation in the scope of the paper to AMCs is
problematic, it is useful to more clearly explain the conceptual framing
the paper uses, "Push" and "Pull" funding. Push funding includes grants,
scientific research funding, and other mechanisms which lead to but do
not actually require production of the final product. This is designed
to pay for innovation and research, but leaves the actual production to
the market, with attendant market failures, which the paper discusses.
Pull funding includes purchases and Advanced Market Commitments, and is
designed to get the final product produced. But other mechanisms, such
as prizes and option-based guarantees do not fit neatly into this
framing, and are therefore unfortunately ignored. They also address very
different parts of the potential market failure, and it seems likely
that many of the issues which exist for AMCs to address technologically
distant targets are better addressed using a combination of approaches,
and AMCs may play a limited role.

As [I have argued elsewhere](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-1154),
there are a variety of tools other than AMCs, including prizes, more
direct public-private partnerships, and the proposed options-based
guarantees. While the last category is most appropriate for urgent but
technologically distant targets, the other two provide more of a
spectrum. They also provide different tradeoffs, for example, because
prizes do not need to pre-select the number of firms. An analysis of the
appropriate tool for different future needs would therefore be even more
useful.

The relevance of AMCs for global priorities is therefore mixed. They are
appropriate and very sorely needed for continued and expanded use in
global health and disease elimination campaigns. As the paper notes,
they have likely already saved 700,000 lives, though how counterfactual
this estimate is remains unclear - but they have the potential to be
used further, and save an order of magnitude more lives in the near
term. They also have potential to accelerate vaccines for known
pandemic-potential pathogen threats, including use for universal
influenza vaccines to address novel influenza, and similarly for
pan-betacoronavirus vaccines. The optimal strategy presumably involves a
mix of different tools, but policy considerations for which approach to
use will also be critical, and the track record of AMCs is a significant
advantage.

On the other hand, for technologically more distant targets, it seems
the paper oversells their usefulness of AMCs compared to the
alternatives. Most critically, the use of AMCs for novel diseases seems
far more limited than other avenues. In the event of a novel disease
pandemic, as COVID-19 showed, funding availability and advanced
purchases were not the key constraint for getting vaccines developed.
Instead, the slow nature of the testing and approval processes were
critical, and AMCs typically do not provide direct marginal incentives
for speed. Additionally, the relative lack of investment in
manufacturing capacity to speed up availability was critical.

On the other hand, if combined with general research funding for
programs like the proposed "prototype pathogen" research, which would
develop candidate vaccines for critical viral families, then AMCs could
be made more useful, though it remains unclear why they would be
preferred to more direct funding and purchases.

## Written report

In "Advance Market Commitments: Insights from Theory and Experience."
Kremer, Levin and Snyder describe the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC)
mechanism that was used to increase coverage of Pneumococcal Conjugate
Vaccines (PCV) in low-income countries. This mechanism represents one of
the most important public health achievements of the recent past leading
to PCV coverage rates of around 50% in eligible countries compared to an
almost 0% coverage rate before the onset of the AMC. The authors
estimate the AMC saved 700,000 lives. This paper provides a convincing
argument for AMCs and a reasonable method for evaluating its effects. I
will highlight two areas where further research could be beneficial.

In evaluating the impact of the AMC, the authors assume that, absent the
AMC, PCV adoption would have followed the same path as Rotavirus vaccine
adoption in the same countries. While this is a reasonable baseline,
there are many reasons why that may not be the case. These vaccines are
produced by different manufacturers who may have different willingness
to supply vaccines to low-income countries. They also impact different
diseases and take-up may reflect the relative importance of treating
these diseases in low-income countries. Future research would be useful
in this area. Perhaps constructing a counterfactual using each
country\'s coverage of additional GAVI supported vaccines and using data
on PCV coverage in countries that are not eligible for the AMC could be
useful.

The theoretical portion of the paper provides a clear model of how the
AMC provides value. Additionally, it makes important points about the
cost of setting the subsidy too low and the potential costs of including
co-payments for eligible countries. In future work it would be valuable
to consider if the AMC is a permanent mechanism or one used to promote
the adoption of a vaccine. Since adoption of a vaccine usually
necessitates large annual expenditures indefinitely (as vaccines are
rarely removed from a national immunization program), it would be
helpful to know how to fund an AMC in perpetuity or how to transition
off the AMC. This point also relates to considering country co-financing
commitments as the hope with these is that countries will eventually be
able to finance these vaccines on their own. Therefore, the cost of
removing county co-financing requirements may be larger than the model
assumes. Relatedly, the model is a one-shot model, but, in reality,
there can be multiple bargaining periods and manufacturers may initially
reject offers but then accept higher offers in later periods. In this
case, risk of setting the price too low initially is less important.
Finally, in many of these cases, the manufactures are not strictly
profit maximizing but are constrained by social pressures to provide
vaccines at an affordable price. It would be useful to understand how
these pressures impact the ability of the manufacturer to bargain over
the vaccine price.

Summary of Kremer, Levin & Snyder\'s Primary Findings

[Kremer, Levin & Snyder
(KLS)](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.dartmouth.edu/dist/5/2287/files/2021/02/w26775.pdf)
find that the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) advanced market commitment
(AMC) probably resulted in around 700,000 lives saved that would
otherwise have been lost.

Counterfactual increase in coverage due to pneumococcal vaccine advanced
market commitment

To estimate the counterfactual impact of the PCV AMC, KLS compare the
actual impact of the PCV AMC rollout to the rotavirus (RV) non-AMC
rollout. This choice of comparator does make sense; as KLS write: \"*We
selected rotavirus from the six global vaccine initiatives proceeding
around that time for the following reasons. Three of them (IPV, second
dose of measles, birth dose of hepatitis) involved early-vintage rather
than new vaccines. The yellow-fever vaccine was not rolled out in many
high-income countries, leaving no good base rate for coverage speed
comparison. We conjecture the results would be stronger using HPV, the
remaining candidate apart from rotavirus, for comparison, but any slow
rollout of HPV vaccine in GAVI countries could be attributed to its
administration to older children, slowing coverage expansion.*\"

That said, there is a reasonable worry over whether the results are
robust to a different comparator class of vaccines when estimating the
counterfactual impact of the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) advanced market
commitment (AMC). To check this point, I run a [rough quantitative
analysis of my
own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ccKrVshCocfKoFrTL5KAwAIps6IS_R__qhIb9sEhL7o/edit?usp=share_link).
I use vaccination data from the following sources:

-   

    > For RCV and RV vaccination, I use the International Vaccine Access
    > Center & John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health\'s
    > [View-Hub](https://view-hub.org/map/) database (last access,
    > 2023-02-02), which draws on WUENIC estimates. WUENIC estimates are
    > official WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage,
    > created by drawing on country-reported data as well as published
    > and grey literature, even while correcting for potential biases

-   

    > For human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) vaccination, I pull from
    > [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/immunization/)
    > (last access, 2023-02-02.

-   

    > For yellow fever (YF) vaccination, I rely on [Shearer et
    > al\'s](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30419X/)
    > estimate of global yellow fever vaccination coverage (last access,
    > 2023-02-03).

The disparate datasets are not ideal, but no single source I found while
undertaking this quick review provides comprehensive data on all
vaccines of relevance. Calculations were done in the linked Google
sheet, last edited 2023-02-05.

Using this data, I first look at the proportion of PCV coverage with the
AMC (across GAVI countries, for the first 12 years from introduction)
relative to full coverage. This was calculated by taking a
population-weighted average of coverage rates per country-year across
all 54 current GAVI countries across 12 years (from introduction in 2010
up to 2021). Based on the aforementioned data and this specific
methodology, overall coverage for GAVI countries across this time period
was 49%.

Second, I look at three different comparator classes: (a) rotavirus
vaccine (RV) coverage, (b) human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) coverage,
as well as yellow fever (YF) vaccine coverage (similarly looking across
GAVI countries across for the first 12 years from introduction or
equivalent). [^1] [^2] These three classes were used as the vaccines in
question are either newer vaccines with a more recent introduction date
(RV & HPV), or else an older vaccine where there appears to be a
discrete recent push for vaccination by GAVI (YF) -- allowing for us to
perhaps observe the counterfactual world in which PVC was rolled out
without an AMC but with standard GAVI support. In each case, I look at
the proportion of the comparator vaccine\'s coverage across GAVI
countries for the first 12 years. And again, this is calculated by
taking a population-weighted average of coverage rates per country-year
across all 54 current GAVI countries across 12 years (n.b. RV: from
introduction in 2006 up to 2017, for comparability; for HPV, from
introduction in 2010 up to 2021; and for YF, from GAVI making a
[concerted
effort](https://www.gavi.org/types-support/vaccine-support/yellow-fever)
on YF in 2001 up to 2012, for comparability).

I find that KLS\'s results should be fairly robust, insofar as the
coverage rates for alternative comparator vaccines are in fact lower
than the mainline RV comparator KLS chose: coverage was 12% for RV, 2%
for HPV, and 9% for YF.

Going further, I estimate the probable proportion of PCV coverage across
GAVI countries across 12 years from introduction without the AMC, by
creating a weighted average of the 3 comparator classes. In doing this,
I firstly penalize dissimilarity in target demographics (n.b. PCV and RV
are both targeted for \<1 year olds, while HPV is for older individuals
and the YF vaccine is for 9 months+ individuals) -- this matters insofar
as the former two vaccines will more likely be deployed as part of
post-birth immunization schedules. Secondly, I penalize data limitations
(e.g. the uncertain YF extrapolations). Weights are assigned
subjectively and fairly aggressively, with each penalty leading to a
comparator class being weighed a magnitude less than it otherwise would
have. In all, the weighted average is 11% -- which is my best-guess
estimate of PCV coverage in the absence of the AMC.

Putting this together, the counterfactual impact of the PCV AMC as a
proportion of total disease burden avertable by vaccinations in the
relevant time period is around 38% relative to total coverage.
Importantly, this estimate here would not differ by much (\~2%) even if
we only used RV as the comparator to estimate the non-AMC counterfactual
-- which suggests that KLS\'s results are robust to comparator class.
That said, I would caution against using these results for direct
comparisons to KLS\'s findings -- this analysis is very rough, and given
the different datasets/methodologies, I would be wary of utilizing these
results for anything except a sense-check for the matter of comparator
class robustness.

There is a further caveat to note -- the datasets used see a
considerable amount of missing data; in such cases, I made the
methodological choice to treat missing data for country-years as 0%
coverage. The idea is that (a) any country lacking the state capacity to
report is unlikely to be doling out vaccines; and (b) such GAVI
countries by definition have GAVI support, and GAVI does publish its
data (which then feeds into the WUENIC estimates) -- so unless GAVI were
failing to report vaccinations (unlikely), it seems reasonable to think
that unreported country-years do in fact suffer 0% coverage.

Robustness of headline DALY estimates

In any case, there are other issues that may affect the accuracy of the
final estimates of DALYs averted:

1.  

    > The estimate relies on [Tasslimi et
    > al\'s](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24038499/) calculations of
    > DALYs averted per PCV shot -- and this in turn relies on [O\'Brien
    > et al\'s](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19748398/) 2009 estimate
    > of the global burden of disease caused by streptococcus
    > pneumoniae. However, DALYs lost per capita to pneumococcus were
    > declining in poor countries year-on-year for two decades even
    > before the AMC, possibly due -- at least in part -- to economic
    > growth bringing improvements in sanitation/nutrition/access to
    > healthcare. Hence, projections on future DALYs averted based on
    > past disease burden data may overstate the benefit. Theoretically,
    > a way to account for this would be to re-run KLS\'s analysis but
    > discounting each year\'s DALY per dose estimate using the rate at
    > which pneumococcus DALY burden per capita was experiencing a
    > secular decline in the two decades before the introduction of the
    > vaccine.

2.

    > development of existing vaccines -- hypothetically, the credible

My sense is that effect 1 would outweigh effect 2, such that the true
effect of the PCV AMC is lower than currently estimated, but it is hard
to say by how much, if at all.

Conclusion

Overall, relative to the null hypothesis (i.e. the AMC did nothing), I
would (a) have extremely high confidence that the AMC made a difference
and saved a significant number of lives; and (b) only moderate
confidence that at least 700,000 lives were saved, per KLS\'s original
estimate.

[^1]: In each case, I take the sum of proportional coverage per
    country-year, and divide by total number of countries (56) as well
    as total number of years (12, which means introduction year 2010 to
    2021 for PCV, introduction year 2006 to 2017 for RV, introduction
    year 2010 to 2021 for HPV, and 2001-2012 for YF on the premise that
    GAVI made a concerted effort on expanding YF vaccine from 2001
    onwards), to get average coverage across GAVI countries in that time
    period.

[^2]: Note that there were significant data limitations with respect to
    the YF calculations. Only 2000 and 2010 vaccination rates were
    available from the
    [[source]{.underline}](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30419X/)
    I found; both WHO and the International Vaccine Access Center/John
    Hopkins View-Hub project were not forthcoming on comprehensive YF
    vaccination rates. To get around this, I assume a linear
    increase/decrease from 2000 to 2010 and then to 2012, thus
    extrapolating the vaccination rates for other years.
