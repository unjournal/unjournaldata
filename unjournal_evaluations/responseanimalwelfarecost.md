# Author's Response (Bruers Stijn)

**Q1:** *Evaluator 1 says "I did not find an online repository for data
and code". Is one available? If not, would you be willing to provide
this?*

**Stijn:** The data is available at:
[https://rdr.kuleuven.be/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.48804/3OEPKY]( "null")\

**Q2:** *Do you agree with Evaluator 1's characterization of your
approach and its pros and cons relative to the other approaches (Kuruc
and McFadden; Espinosa; see the comparison table given)?*

**Stijn: **I very much agree with it.\

**Q3:** *Do you agree with the "several important limits" Evaluator 1
says you acknowledge? How would you suggest (or how are you planning) to
address these in future work?*

**Stijn: **I agree. The sample size is small, but I doubt that a larger
sample size could mitigate the two major problems:

-   the discrepancy between WTA and WTP (comparable to an extremely
    large endowment effect), and

-   the discrepancy between median and mean (i.e. the skewness of the
    distribution).

The survey questions may be too hypothetical. The animal welfare cost of
meat could probably be much better estimated with different survey
methodology, that asks directly about welfare estimates and welfare
ranges of farmed animals (relative to humans). These welfare estimates
could be translated in monetary terms using the value of a statistical
(human) life. See the study Bruers, S. (2025). A Survey on Inter-animal
Welfare Comparisons. *Journal of Applied Animal Ethics
Research*, *1*(aop), 1-21.\

**Q4:** *Could you check/report the demographic representativeness along
other lines?* 

**Stijn: **The survey is not representative according to education and
slightly representative according to income: 

-   51% of survey respondents had a higher education degree, compared to
    32% of the adult Belgian population.

-   The average disposable household income of survey respondents was
    3200€/month (standard deviation 1400€/month), compared to
    2700€/month for Belgium.\

**Q5:** *"Open-ended questions like these are known to suffer from
hypothetical bias ... \[and\] tend to have high cognitive load relative
to, say, double-bounded dichotomous choice or a discrete choice
experiment." Do you have a response --- if you were to do another study
and had a lot of resources, (how) would you change this approach?*

**Stijn: **A discrete choice experiment might be preferred (this could
mitigate the discrepancy between WTA and WTP). The present survey could
be used as a pilot study for a DCE, to determine optimal attribute
levels. Nevertheless, the hypothetical nature of the choices remains. \

**Q6:** *Concerns about anthropocentric valuations of animal welfare and
potential misunderstanding of farm conditions etc. --- both evaluators
note this.*

**Stijn: **I think the anthropocentric nature is unavoidable: all
currently proposed animal welfare estimate methodologies contain
significant anthropocentrism. A primary challenge is how to estimate and
avoid biases of meat eaters and vegans: meat eaters may underestimate
farmed animal suffering, but vegans (who are vegan for ethical reasons)
may perhaps overestimate it. 

\
**Q7:** *"More complete policy modelling" --- any thoughts on the next
steps/approaches for this? Is it something you are involved in?*

**Stijn: **Yes, I am involved in the growing academic field of animal
welfare economics, where one of the aims is to construct more complete
models for optimizing human and animal welfare.

**Q8: ***Concerns with measures of altruistic WTP*

E1:

> One major source of caution concerns the interpretation of the results
> related to the marginal altruistic WTP. This quantity is approximated
> through the WTP for the replacement of one kilogram of conventional
> meat supply with one kilogram of cultured meat. However, it is unclear

> food (food neophobia), they could hold naturalistic views about food
> (i.e., a reluctance against food tech), etc. At the altruistic level,
> individuals could also think that cultured meat would prevent the
> birth of some animals, which, even if their net lifetime welfare is
> negative, would not be socially desirable.

**Stijn: **Yes, I agree with \[this\] criticism: there are many
confounding factors to measure the marginal WTP using questions about
cultivated meat. The same goes for hypothetical questions about e.g.
meat from animals that are genetically programmed to not feel any
suffering. I don\'t know of another method used in the literature that
captures the full marginal WTP to avoid all suffering of a farmed
animal, without confounding elements. As animals on animal welfare
certified farms still experience some non-zero suffering, traditional
research methodologies involving WTP for animal-welfare-labelled meat do
not capture the full WTP to avoid all suffering, and also involve
confounding factors such as the level of trust in the certification
scheme.
