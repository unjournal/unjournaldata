# Abstract 

We organized one evaluation of the paper: "Does Conservation Work in
General Equilibrium" under our ["interim evaluation"
policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QgVvSXo3Q9j6n3nx__sNIxKOOjtBqz_y0wb15kWexdc/edit#heading=h.24c4ztbeoiz5 "null").[^1]

## **Evaluations**

1\. [Evaluator
1](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/e1generalequilibrium "null")

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment: **We asked them to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5):**[^2]** **On a 'scale
of journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?
(See ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null").)

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1[^5]

This paper investigates the impacts of conservation policies on
deforestation, \[...\] explicitly \[taking\] into account indirect
general equilibrium effects. Intuitively, protecting land in certain
locations affects local land prices, wages, and agricultural output
prices that may lead to deforestation elsewhere, given that regional
markets are interconnected -- this is known in the literature as
'leakage.' Though widely acknowledged as conceptually important, the
existing empirical works have not yet explicitly dealt with this issue,
except via 'reduced form' spillovers, focusing on regions that are
adjacent to protected areas (PA). This 'traditional' approach, though
informative, is not fully satisfying as spillovers may affect
non-adjacent regions as well. As I see it, this is a crucial gap in the
literature that this paper aims to fill. That is an important
contribution.

\
To do so, the authors develop a quantitative spatial equilibrium model
of the Brazilian economy. They find that targeting protection in the
regions with highest deforestation levels can be effective, despite the
fact that leakage increases significantly in a longer time-horizon.
Specifically, after one year, 2-3% of the deforestation reductions are
outdone by leakage, which is pretty small. Although this number
increases to 10% after 10 years, it is still sufficiently small in my
estimation to justify protecting the land.

# Unjournal process notes

We are evaluating this under our [interim evaluation"
policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QgVvSXo3Q9j6n3nx__sNIxKOOjtBqz_y0wb15kWexdc/edit#heading=h.24c4ztbeoiz5 "null").
David Reinstein is serving as the evaluation manager.

This is an evaluation of an interim version of "Does Conservation Work
in General Equilibrium?" by Veronica Salazar Restrepo and Gabriel Leite
Mariante. This version was shared with us in \~April 2024. This
evaluates a version of this paper the authors updated in March 2024 and
privately shared with us. However, the authors wanted to make it clear
that this is not their final version, and they are planning further
updates, including in response to the evaluation below. We may ask for
further evaluations/followups on a future revised version.

## Why we chose this paper 

Ben Balmford suggested that we consider this paper. He noted (excerpting
this):

> This paper explores whether conservation interventions have a net
> positive effect on the environment, once you account for potential
> leakage. Leakage - probably "negative spillovers" to most economists -
> is the idea that if we intervene with some conservation measure, we
> are in effect going to reduce production (typically this is
> agriculture, in situ, with reductions at the extensive margin; but I
> guess could be any other good and could be at the intensive margin).
> The point is that this is likely to raise the price of these goods
> (and substitutes) and increase production (again, either extensive or
> intensive margin) somewhere else.
>
> This is IMO a key issue in a whole range of environmental issues, and
> has been poorly dealt with to date \[with a few exceptions\]...

The 'assessor' gave a second opinion (excerpted):

> Clearly an important issue for climate change policies, and for other
> forms of intervention in other areas of interest (perhaps animal
> welfare, other GCRs, other forms of pollution) ... if you make 'doing
> the (bad) thing' harder in one area, you may reduce production drive
> up prices and lead to 'more of the bad thing' in other areas.
> Important to measure and quantify this for considering the impact of
> policies and interventions, and perhaps even charity-driven subsidies
> to 'not do something'. ...

## Author engagement

The authors granted permission for us to evaluate this under the
aforementioned 'interim' policy, and to share this evaluation publicly,
They said they appreciated the suggestions and are working to address
these in their next draft. They have not yet provided an 'authors
response', but indicated some willingness to respond in the future.

## COI considerations

The 'assessor' of this paper, David Reinstein, also served as the
evaluation manager for this paper. However, four other members of our
team (in addition to the suggester and the assessor) voted in favor of
prioritizing the paper.

# Other comments and considerations from The Unjournal management

Ben Balmford, who suggested this paper, noted

> This is IMO a key issue in a whole range of environmental issues, and
> has been poorly dealt with to date (exceptions I would say are the
> recent AER: I paper on battery recycling, and Sabrina Eisenbarth's
> slightly older paper in JEEM on fisheries). Leakage is obviously a
> problem for identification, owing to breaking the SUTVA assumption,
> but perhaps more importantly is also a problem when we come to think
> about intervention effectiveness. Perhaps particularly relevant at the
> moment owing to the "additionality crisis" which has gripped the
> voluntary carbon market and Verra in particular. Additionality and
> leakage are linked in the sense that additionality = would this local
> effect have been observed absent intervention, and if the answer is
> yes, that presumably means that some production has been lost, opening
> up the potential for leakage. (NB: this idea is called the
> additionality-leakage duality in a paper by Ben Filewood, at the LSE -
> that itself is a decent paper aimed more at the science side).

> 10% leakage rate (driven by intensification and reallocation of both
> workers and land).

[^1]: This evaluates a version of this paper the authors updated in
    March 2024 and privately shared with us. However, the authors wanted
    to make it clear that this is not their final version, and they are
    planning further updates, including in response to the evaluation
    below. We may ask for further evaluations/followups on a future
    revised version.

[^6]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^7]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^8]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^9]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^10]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^11]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^12]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?
