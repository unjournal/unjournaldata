# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"Water Treatment and Child
Mortality: A Meta-analysis and Cost-effectiveness
Analysis\"[@njfs16xzh88]. To read these evaluations, please see the
links below. The first was a team effort by Hugh Sharma Waddington and
Edoardo Masset, who recently published a related systematic review; this
evaluation focuses mainly on the meta-analysis and the studies therein.
The second (anonymous) evaluation focuses more on the cost-effectiveness
analysis. Both evaluators agree that this paper tackles an important
question and provides an advance on our prior understanding of the
effects of water treatment on child mortality. Both also found areas
where the paper could be improved or clarified.

# Evaluation summaries

## Sharma Waddington & Masset

We evaluated the conduct, analysis and interpretation of the
meta-analysis findings. The paper concerns an important topic for the
global burden of infectious disease, particularly in middle-income
countries where most of the included studies were conducted. It presents
useful information on childhood mortality following water treatment and
protection interventions. However, we had major concerns about conduct
and reporting, which did not follow systematic review standards of
transparency, and we also had major concerns about the interpretation of
the findings for policy and research.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

1\. I do not see any major technical issues with the paper.

2\. The paper can be positioned more robustly i.e., the "need for it"
needs to be better argued.

3\. While the "effect" (mortality reduction) side of the paper has been
done well, the "cost" part of the paper could be deepened. This would
position it better and be supremely useful to policymakers.

# Evaluation manager's discussion

The Unjournal solicited two evaluations of the paper "Water treatment
and child mortality: a meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis."
The paper was flagged to us as important by a staff member at a major
philanthropic organization, and our screening indeed suggested it could
be highly influential in moving money to water treatment.

The paper does two things. It first pools evidence from many studies and
so allows the authors to have the statistical precision to examine the
effect of water treatment on child mortality directly. This is an
improvement over past work that attempted to back out such an effect
indirectly, by looking at much more common indirect signals of mortality
like diarrhea.

The second thing the paper does is use the meta-analytic results to do a
cost-effectiveness exercise to see how cost-effective is water treatment
at avoiding death (or increasing DALYs). The main takeaway is direct
estimates of water treatment show much higher reductions in mortality
than do indirect methods. In turn, this means that water treatment is
estimated to be much more cost-effective at averting deaths than was
previously thought.

I solicited two reviews of this paper. While all the evaluators looked
at the entire paper, I asked one team of evaluators to focus more on the
meta-analysis and studies therein and a second evaluator to focus more
on the cost-effectiveness analysis. Both evaluators agree that the paper
tackles an important question and provides an advance on our prior
understanding of the effects of water treatment on child mortality. Both
also found areas where the paper could be improved or clarified. Our
first evaluators, who worked in a team, raised many questions and
helpful criticisms. These include:

1.  Questions about study inclusion and exclusion and transparency.

2.  Issues of data quality and analysis transparency, such as what
    appear to be undisclosed deviations from the pre-registration plan
    and changes in the odds ratios of the underlying studies between
    drafts.

3.  Questions for scale up and policy, such as the representativeness of
    the sample, questions around mechanisms, and concerns around the
    persistence of the behavioural change.

Our second evaluation focused more heavily on the CEA model and had two
major suggestions. The first was around the framing of the study. The
second focused on ways to make the CEA more useful for policymakers,
including:

1.  Disaggregating costs to allow individual policymakers to essentially
    make selections off of a menu to match the CEA to their situation
    more closely.

2.  Sensitivity analysis of the CEA, making use of the estimates of
    uncertainty from the meta-analysis.

The authors have responded to both evaluations and updated the working
paper in response. While not all of the changes to the paper have yet
been implemented, my personal reading is that the evaluators noted a
number of ways that the paper could be improved, it in turn was
improved, and while the headline result remains largely the same, we
have now learned some new things about:

1.  The stability of the results of various changes in the data

2.  Additional important points in the CEA that were not clear to me up
    front, such as the important role of compliance in affecting the
    results

3.  Important limitations in most existing economic research that
    prevents meta-analyses from being conducted or greatly limits their
    usefulness. In particular I'm thinking of participant flow diagrams
    in studies.

Anyone with an interest in this topic should read the evaluations and
response in full as my summary comments contain some of my own
interpretation and both the evaluators and authors may disagree with
parts. A major advantage of open review is that one can read the
exchange directly and form their own opinion.

I extend my sincere thanks to the evaluators and the authors for what I
view as a fulfilling and transparent cooperative effort to reach the
best possible answer to an important question.

# Unjournal process notes 

***Note on versions: ***This working paper had two public drafts. The
evaluators were recruited after the first (NBER) draft was posted online
but when we learned that the authors were close to publishing a second
draft we froze the process and waited for the newer draft to be
published. The evaluation is of the second (May 2024) draft, though
reviewers may at times make points that compare across the drafts as
they read both.

## Why we chose this paper 

This work is very relevant to charity recommendations on water
interventions.  From our team notes "Kremer's work on WASH inform\[ed\]
Evidence Action's \$64 million grant". GiveWell was one of the funders
of this research and they indicated a strong interest in having it
evaluated. Furthermore, at least one senior academic and another senior
applied researcher outside our team specifically suggested this.

For a \~nontechnical discussion, see GiveWell's blog "[Research
Strategy:
Water]( https://blog.givewell.org/2024/06/26/research-strategy-water/ "null")"
(updated July 2024).

## How we chose (and tasked) the evaluators

We selected evaluators with WASH research experience and we drew them
from both the public health and development economics communities. As
noted above "one team of evaluators was asked to focus more on the
meta-analysis and studies therein and a second evaluator to focus more
on the cost-effectiveness analysis." The 'team evaluation' mode seemed
particularly promising, and something we may pursue again in future
evaluations.

    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^9]: Policy decision making should be based on the results of
    systematic, critically appraised evidence rather than single
    studies, hence we agree broadly with the approach the reviewers have
    taken to collect and synthesize the evidence systematically. The
    topic of the review is highly relevant for global health policy,
    perhaps even more so than the reviewers indicate themselves. For
    example, interventions that aim to provide populations access to
    improved water supplies in quantity and/or quality have been shown
    in systematic reviews as strongly associated with reductions in
    diarrhoeal illness (Wolf et al., 2023), yet a systematic link to
    reported mortality had not been made until recently (Sharma
    Waddington et al., 2023). This is important since an estimated 90
    percent of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) for diarrhoea are
    due to mortality, mainly in childhood, the remaining 10 percent
    being accounted for by episodes of illness across the whole
    population. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates for water
    supplies are currently based on systematic reviews of morbidity,
    under the strong assumption that morbidity due to causes like
    diarrhoea is closely correlated with mortality. By collecting data
    from participant flow diagrams in reports of randomised controlled
    trials (RCTs) published in health journals, and by obtaining
    unpublished data on mortality from authors working in development
    economics and health, the reviewers provide direct estimates of
    mortality from water treatment and protection interventions, which
    can potentially be used in future GBD calculations. We also believe
    there is much to praise about this paper's methodological ambition
    to provide information for decision makers. For example, it includes
    cost-effectiveness analysis of various interventions, which is
    rarely done in meta-analyses, and employs prediction intervals to
    estimate the impact of a new intervention, and in this way it aims
    to account for heterogeneity between studies. Finally, it undertakes
    sensitivity analyses including estimating frequentist and Bayesian
    meta-analyses, together with an assessment of small study effects
    that finds no evidence for publication bias for mortality outcomes,
    which is a very rare finding in the literature on intervention
    effects.

[^10]: Definitely a high quality study with clear, replicable methods.
    As I write in my review, I think the authors could do a bit more to
    frame or position this study better - which speaks to how it
    contributes to the field.

[^11]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to
    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^12]: An important aspect of systematic reviewing is transparency in
    conduct and reporting, which helps to ensure the analysis can be
    replicated by others. The authors conducted systematic searches for
    published RCTs on water treatment, harvesting data on mortality that
    were reported in participant flow diagrams in some studies, and
    contacting authors of RCTs to obtain unpublished data on mortality.
    A previous version of the working paper omitted several trials that
    were included in a systematic review and meta-analysis of water,
    sanitation and hygiene (WASH) by us, several of which have since
    been included in the review. In several respects, the reviewers are
    transparent about what they've done. For example, Fig 1 provides
    information about the search process and Table S2 provides
    information about which studies were excluded from the analysis,
    together with the reason why, although not in the usual form that a
    systematic review would provide. However, several studies of
    apparently eligible interventions, which reported all-cause
    mortality in participant flow diagrams, remain excluded from the
    analysis. These include Ercumen et al. (2015) which reports
    all-cause mortality from two trial arms (chlorine plus safe storage
    and safe storage alone), and Bowen et al. (2012), a long-term
    follow-up of another HWT study already included (Luby et al., 2006);
    both report higher mortality rates in the house-hold water treatment
    group than in the control. There are other points of inconsistency
    in decision-making that we noticed. For example, as noted by the
    authors in the supplementary materials, several study arms are of
    multicomponent interventions where HWT is provided alongside
    cookstoves and sanitation and hygiene. While it is clear how some
    multicomponent HWT intervention arms were assessed (e.g. Luby et
    al., 2018; Null et al., 2018), it is not clear how multicomponent
    HWT intervention arms from other studies were evaluated (e.g.,
    Semenza et al. 1998). We were also surprised that a RCT on household
    water chlorination in Kenya by one of the authors (Kremer et al.,
    2008) was not included in the analysis or in Table S2. We understand
    that the working paper we have been sent to review is the second
    draft, the first draft being publicly circulated in 2023. We noted
    that the odds ratio estimates differ, in some cases considerably,
    between the two working paper drafts, hence we believe the authors
    should report inter-rater assessments on effect size data extraction
    and/or to indicate how discrepancies were resolved. Another key
    component of systematic reviewing is transparent critical appraisal
    of the included evidence using risk-of-bias assessment, to help the
    reader understand how trustworthy are the findings. The authors did
    conduct a risk-of-bias assessment, using a tool that was developed
    to assess observational studies, but the assessments are not
    discussed anywhere in the text or supplement, other than to indicate
    that all studies are RCTs and that reported mortality is an unbiased
    measure. As is well known, RCTs can be at 'high risk of bias' due to
    problems in de-sign or conduct, an example being selection biases
    due to high (or highly differential) losses to follow-up (attrition)
    in treatment and control arms, or late joiners in cluster-RCTs. The
    risk-of-bias ratings reported in the supplementary materials range
    between 4 and 7 out of a total possible score of 11. However,
    evidence suggests it is not appropriate to determine overall bias
    using quality scales (Jüni et al., 1999). Authors of critical
    appraisal tools have instead shown that it is possible to assess
    overall bias based on transparent decision criteria (e.g., Eldridge
    et al., 2019; Sterne et al., 2016). The reviewers should comment on
    the implications of the risk-of-bias assessment for the confidence
    in the findings at the review level. The authors considered the
    between-study heterogeneity at the review level, and predicted study
    effectiveness beyond the sample considered as measured by the
    Bayesian uncertainty analysis. However, in the Bayesian
    meta-analysis, the posterior estimates for individual studies differ
    from the frequentist model, sometimes considerably; for example, the
    estimate for Luby et al. (2006) shifts from a whopping OR=23.88 (95%
    confidence interval (CI)=0.08, 7240) to OR=0.74 (95%CI=0.37, 1.49).
    It would be useful for readers, who may be less familiar with
    Bayesian meta-analysis, if the reviewers can explain why these
    differences are so large.

[^13]: The study executes a meta-analysis using both frequentist and
    Bayesian models to derive odds-ratios (OR) for reductions in child
    mortality from a variety of water chlorination programs. It derives
    a high-quality result with careful and clear inclusion of studies
    and an extensive sensitivity analysis.

[^14]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^15]: It is standard practice in systematic reviews and meta-analyses
    on WASH topics to report transparently on the populations,
    interventions and the counterfactual water supply and sanitation
    conditions. It is common for WASH interventions to be implemented in
    conjunction with other treatments, which also may have independent
    or interactive effects on morbidity and mortality. This has no
    direct implication on the meta-analysis or on the estimation, but it
    might change the interpretation of the results. However, the front
    section of the paper does not clarify whether the studies included
    are standalone water treatment and protection interventions or
    whether they are implemented alongside other interventions. The
    reviewers could qualify their conclusions by observing that the
    results should be interpreted as approximations of the effects of
    "water treatment and protection", if "water treatment and
    protection" interventions (in the included studies) are implemented
    as packages including other activities affecting morbidity and
    mortality. The reviewers reported an overall pooled effect together
    with a sub-group effect for chlorination. However, there was a
    potentiality for pooling effects for filtration, where there were
    three estimates. Perhaps the reviewers felt that the Peletz et al.
    (2012) study, conducted among immuno-compromised groups, was not
    representative of general contexts; but we note that, even if that
    study was excluded, meta-analytical pooling can be undertaken
    provided there is more than one independent effect size. It would
    also be useful for the reviewers to report the random effects weight
    of each study in the meta-analysis, as well as relative and absolute
    between-study heterogeneity (I-squared and Tau-squared) for all
    analyses conducted including sub-groups. Having a low value of
    heterogeneity helps the reader understand if the pooled effect is
    likely to be valid within the sample of studies included in the
    meta-analysis. A purpose of meta-analysis is to explain the
    heterogeneity in estimates across studies. The reviewers conducted
    analysis of adherence and length of follow-up, among other factors,
    finding no strong association between mortality and adherence but a
    negative effect for follow-up length (that is, there was no
    significant effect for follow-ups beyond 52 weeks, as has also been
    found for diarrhoea morbidity). It is very difficult to measure
    adherence accurately since it is impossible to prevent populations
    from drinking other (unimproved) water sources, and because other
    disease transmission mechanisms may be more or less important in
    high-risk environments (e.g., when sanitation is classified as
    unimproved so most people are openly defaecating or using shared
    facilities that do not adequately remove excreta from the
    environment). On a similar note, the study does not discuss the
    interaction of the interventions with the baseline characteristics
    of the environment. The sensitivity analysis considers the baseline
    prevalence of diarrhoea, and the reviewers observe that the
    meta-analysis was not sufficiently powered to conduct a
    disaggregated analysis. However, the reviewers could discuss a more
    about how the results could differ in different contexts, since this
    has been a major concern in the literature.

[^16]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^17]: The review presents the numbers of deaths in treatment and
    control groups for all of the studies included in the meta-analysis
    in Table S3. This has required great effort on the part of the
    reviewers, and stands to be useful to researchers working on the
    effectiveness of interventions to reduce mortality in childhood for
    years to come. However, we are also concerned that the review was
    not reported using standards of systematic review transparency. For
    example, a purpose of a systematic review protocol is to enable help
    ensure reviewers are not making results-based choices (consciously
    or otherwise). This does not mean that deviations from protocol are
    not allowed, simply that they should be noted as such. The review
    was registered with the AEA registry in June 2020, but standard
    information reported in systematic reviews like a PRISMA study
    search flow diagram, or a PRISMA checklist that indicates, for
    example, deviations from protocol, are not given. There do appear to
    be deviations from the AEA registry record, such as the original
    exclusion of "cases where the study population is considered to be
    non-representative (e.g. interventions targeting HIV+ populations)"
    (Tan and Kremer, 2020). Yet the reviewers include a study of water
    filters and safe storage by Rachel Peletz and colleagues (Peletz et
    al., 2012) conducted among immunocompromised households. We believe
    that the review clearly highlights that current standards for
    reporting of RCTs, especially in social science, are not fit for
    purpose. Reputable journals publishing field trials in health
    require the reporting of CONSORT participant flow diagrams, which
    show numbers of individual participants by study arm from
    recruitment of clusters and individuals within clusters, through
    follow-ups, together with important reasons for attrition like death
    in childhood (Moher et al., 1998). Without this information it is
    difficult to assess important threats to validity in these studies,
    which might occur due to problems in design and conduct. It is not
    sufficient to publish data openly, as many economics journals
    require, in order to assess them. For example, a key aspect of the
    internal validity in cluster-RCTs is knowledge about the point at
    which individual participants were recruited, so that total and
    differential selection bias into the study from joiners can be
    assessed; the same follows for selection bias out of the study
    (attrition), although this is more commonly evaluated. It can also
    be useful to know who dropped out of the study between enrolment and
    randomization stages to evaluate external validity. What the review
    demonstrates is that this lack of participant flow reporting is
    extremely costly. Had the participant flows been reported
    transparently, there would have been less need for the reviewers to
    contact RCT authors to obtain the attrition data on all-cause
    mortality in childhood - which the reviewers themselves noted was
    "time-consuming... and led to the loss of some data that was once
    available but is no longer available" (p.16) - and the ability to
    evaluate the credibility of the findings from the studies would be
    dramatically improved. RCTs are costly to undertake financially and
    often require substantial time engagement by participants, so there
    is a strong ethical and, as shown in the review, policy argument for
    authors to report participant flows, and for journals and
    commissioners to require them to do so. We also had concerns about
    the cost-effectiveness analysis. Firstly, the reviewers used the
    Bayesian meta-analysis estimate across the whole sample of studies,
    including filtration, spring protection and solar disinfection.
    However, since two of the cost-effectiveness estimates directly
    concern chlorination, it would seem more appropriate to use the
    pooled meta-analytic effects for chlorination in cost-effectiveness
    analysis. Secondly, sensitivity analyses to different assumptions
    are not reported. Finally, we believe that the positionality of the
    reviewers is not addressed adequately in the paper. It would be
    useful to know, for example, if the included RCTs conducted by the
    reviewers were appraised by different authors. Furthermore, one of
    the reviewers is a Board member of Evidence Action, the campaigning
    NGO that provided data on which one of the cost-effectiveness
    scenario estimates is based, and another is a PI of two studies that
    led to the organisation's earliest campaigns (Chlorination of
    Drinking Water and Deworm the World). We might expect these
    associations to be mentioned in author declarations due to the
    potential for conflict of interest.

[^18]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^19]: The reviewers say that "the studies included in the meta-analysis
    are broadly representative of the settings in which policymakers
    might implement water treatment programs" (p.15). It is hard to
    believe that 18 studies could represent the contextual variability
    one would find within and across countries. It would be useful to
    understand who are the policymakers that would find this sample
    representative. Perhaps it should be accepted that the sample is not
    representative of contextual variability. But if it is
    representative, we suggest adding some supporting evidence of this
    because the argument as it stands is not very convincing. It is
    important to understand the different routes of infection
    transmission, and which particular diarrhoea-causing pathogens
    drinking water treatment and protection can address, in order to
    understand the relevance and generalisability of the findings for
    policy. Diarrhoea in L&MIC contexts is caused by exposure to viruses
    (especially rotavirus), protozoa (especially cryptosporidium) and
    bacteria (especially E.Coli and Shigella) (Kotloff et al., 2013).
    However, water treatments may not reduce faecal contamination if the
    treatment technology itself is not efficacious in combating
    parasitic infections (Arnold and Colford, 2007). An example would be
    chlorination which kills bacteria and most viruses -- and has the
    advantage of providing residual protection -- but, in usual doses,
    is ineffective against cryptosporidium, a common cause of diarrhoea
    in low-income contexts, especially among immunocompromised groups
    such as those living with HIV (Abubakar et al., 2007). Filtration,
    while efficacious against bacteria and larger protozoans, is less
    efficacious against common viruses like rotavirus, and also requires
    safe storage for sustained efficacy as there is no residual
    protection. But in order to understand generalisability of the
    findings from a review of behaviour change interventions, one also
    needs to understand if desired behaviours are practised and
    sustained, such as if sufficient protective agents are applied to
    treat drinking water or adequate personal hygiene practised at the
    point of use so that contaminated hands or utensils are not placed
    in water storage containers. One aspect of this is to assess rates
    of adherence and sustainability, as done by the reviewers, and
    discussed above. Factors causing dis-adoption include, in the case
    of chlorination, users disliking the odour and taste of chlorinated
    water. Much of the evidence on water treatment has come from RCTs
    conducted at zero or negligible financial costs to participants,
    with frequent follow-up by outsiders and disruption of normal
    domestic routines (the "gringo effect"), and over relatively short
    periods of time (Waddington et al., 2009). There is therefore a high
    potentiality in these studies for Hawthorne effects, where being
    observed leads to greater efforts to adhere to treatment protocols,
    favoring the treatment group in unblinded trials. This bias is
    especially likely to occur when follow-up and measurement occurs
    frequently, as it does in many household water treatment
    interventions. For example, in analysis that includes many of the
    studies used in the Kremer meta-analysis, Pickering et al. (2019:
    e1143) report that "virtually all the evidence that promotion of...
    point-of-use water treatment with chlorine or flocculent
    disinfectant reduce diarrhoea come from studies that had daily to
    fortnightly contact between the behaviour change promoter and study
    participant". The findings, therefore, may be unreliable guides to
    the effectiveness of real-world programmes where participants are
    required to undertake behavioural modifications that require
    children's carers always treat household drinking water while also
    ensuring that they never drink water from unsafe sources.

[^20]: This is my major qualm with the work. I find it a little hard to
    believe that policymakers---both globally, and at the national and
    local levels in the health sector---are unconvinced that clean water
    is a top choice when allocating their funds. To this end, my
    suggestion to the authors is to think carefully about how they
    position their work and also I suggest that they improve their
    cost-effectiveness analysis by adding some useful sophistication to
    the cost model.

[^21]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^22]: In theory the topic (interventions to block diarrhoeal disease
    transmission) and approach (systematic review and meta-analysis) are
    potentially highly useful for global prioritization efforts. Our
    major concerns were with the conduct, reporting and interpretation
    of the findings of the review. In addition, frequent use of the WHO
    GDP threshold was made, but we note that many commentators within
    and outside WHO have expressed their scepticism about this threshold
    and its use in decision-making. The GDP threshold is still widely
    used today, and the current study is not exceptional in this.
    However, since the threshold has been criticised in many ways, we
    suggest that the reviewers report the limitations of using the
    threshold for decision-making, and explain how the threshold should
    be interpreted for decision-making purposes in this particular
    context.

[^23]: Yes - with some improvements as I suggest in my review.
