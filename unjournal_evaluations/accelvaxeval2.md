# Abstract 

This paper tackles an important global priority area. The main
limitations are the premise being restricted to private sector
investment, and parameter values used. A societal perspective including
(up to 100%) publicly owned efforts, and different reasonable parameter
value assumptions, including optimising number of vaccine candidates in
relation to expected outbreaks and infections, would alter the
conclusions. Calculating cost per QALY gained, and in relation to
current healthcare expenditure, would further strengthen the paper.

The abstract above contains the evaluator's summary of their evaluation
of "Accelerating Vaccine Innovation for Emerging Infectious Diseases via
Parallel Discovery\"[@temp_id_1679118322971509].

# Written report[^2]

My comments are focused on the premise of the paper, and the assumptions
and parameter values used -- it seems likely that different reasonable
assumptions would alter the conclusions of the paper. In this regard the
paper would benefit from a societal perspective and an expanded
sensitivity analysis, which is explained and reported more clearly in
the paper.

1.  The premise of the paper is that "the goal is to create a
    sustainable business model for addressing EIDs effectively". If the
    paper was focused on a broader goal of "addressing EIDs
    effectively", i.e., looking beyond private sector business models
    and also including public sector (government funded) provision
    (including hypothetical 100% public sector efforts with no private
    sector involvement, i.e., those driven purely by missions to address
    EIDs effectively), it might very well come to different conclusions
    as cost parameter values could be very different including there
    being no need to produce a profit for private businesses.

2.  Related to the above, an analysis of "market failure" to produce
    vaccines for EID would be useful. This could follow from Section
    IIA, which already touches on these issues, and would likely point
    to the need for public sector efforts, including 100% publicly owned
    efforts oriented to addressing EIDs and securing human health rather
    than narrowly to making financial profits.

3.  Following from the above if Net Present Value (NPV) was calculated
    from the perspective of society (e.g. valuing health gains based on
    willingness to pay for QALYs or opportunity costs of existing
    government health expenditure in terms of cost paid per QALY gained
    -- this is around £12,000 in the UK), rather than narrowly from the
    private sector investors perspective, the results and conclusion
    would be completely different, and likely highly recommend the
    vaccines are created and trialled, especially if there is some
    portfolio optimisation at the outset (see points 5 and 6 on this
    below).

4.  Page 7: "number of EID outbreaks prevented" -- this seems to assume
    vaccines will prevent an outbreak rather than mitigate the impact of
    the outbreak? No details are provided on this point, or the "social
    impact" in general and how it is calculated.

5.  End of page 7, beginning of page 8: "we do not.. .. perform any
    portfolio optimization" -- as the authors acknowledge in the
    previous paragraph, this (as done for CEPI) is likely to be
    beneficial, so should really have been done in this paper as another
    option they look at -- one that would likely have more positive
    results. The authors only crudely look at portfolio size in their
    sensitivity analysis and find a large effect -- why not optimise the
    portfolio? This could at least be easily done in relation to the
    expected benefits shown Table 1 (see below point).

6.  Table 1 -- how did you decide Nvac for each disease? For example,
    why are there 23 candidates for West Nile Virus, which has an
    expected annual probability of outbreak of 10% and average number of
    infections of 500, whereas there are only 7 candidates for Lassa
    even though the annual probability of outbreak is 100% and the
    expected number of infections is 300,000. Changing these would
    likely have a large impact on your results.

7.  Table 2 narrative: Alpha-tech of 1.2, a 20% increase in PoS
    (probability of success) of mRNA technology is modest, and in the
    sensitivity analysis you only vary this to 30% and find decreasing
    rather than increasing NPV likely because you don't optimise the
    portfolio - the numbers of vaccine candidates (Nvac) for each
    disease (see above point on Table 1) could be chosen in relation to
    the expected benefits. If this was done and an increased PoS tested
    it's possible there could be significant NPV.

8.  Bottom of page 12: why assume the vaccine price is \$20 in your main
    analysis, when you recognise this is less than the list price of all
    adult vaccines in the US so likely to be an underestimate? Why not
    use the average list price? In the sensitivity analysis you then
    talk about prices being above \$100 in the US sometimes, and that
    only \$78 is needed for your results to show positive NPV. So this
    would alter your conclusions, yet in the abstract you don't mention
    this sensitivity analysis, or indeed any of your sensitivity
    analyses, alter your conclusions. The point about low-and middle
    income countries not being able to afford it seems out of place with
    the premise of your paper requiring private sector profits.

9.  End of part IV, page 14: "social impact" -- how is this defined? No
    details or justification are given in the methods section.

10. Results -- "the vaccine megafund will require \$9.5billion funding
    from the public sector to generate positive financial value for
    investors" -- this may be a price worth paying for human health
    security, though going back to points 1-3 above, if the system is
    wholly publicly owned, the concerns of private investors don't need
    to be taken into account, especially considering the public sector
    could pay for the vaccines (\$20 per dose) anyway.

11. Results: "Using even the most conservative "quality adjusted life
    year" estimate (e.g., Neumann, Cohen, and Weinstein, 2014), the
    lives saved and socioeconomic losses avoided by the vaccines far
    exceed the negative financial value of the megafund." -- It would be
    good to show estimates of QALYs gained, and methods used to
    calculate them, and factor them into the overall results e.g. using
    cost-per-QALY willingness to pay estimates (assuming public
    healthcare provision) or opportunity cost per QALY gained of current
    healthcare expenditure (see point 3 above). This would likely make a
    convincing case for (public) investment in the vaccine megafund i.e.
    would result in an opposite conclusion of the paper to the current
    one.

12. Table 4 footnote -- an annual discount rate of 10% is very high.
    Typically 3-5% is used in health economic evaluations: see Table 1
    of <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5999124/.>
    [@temp_id_8934508246319641]

13. Sensitivity analysis B: "However, due to cannibalization between
    vaccines targeting the same EID and the stochastic nature of EID
    outbreaks, the ultimate revenues increase by a much smaller amount
    than the investment." - this result seems to be heavily dependent on
    the assumptions about cannibalisation, which are not explained in
    the paper. These should be explained, and varied. Also, if the
    premise of the paper included a wholly publicly funded system (see
    points 1-3 above) then the problem of cannibalisation could
    disappear.\

14. Sensitivity analysis D: what is the assumed pHCT and what is it
    based on? This is not shown or explained in the paper, though from
    the appendix (Table S1) it's apparent HCT is only increased to 30%.
    If pHCT approaches 100% surely the results would change and there
    may be positive NPV? This should be shown.\

15. Discussion -- the authors note the utility and reduced costs of
    adaptive and platform trials. These should ideally be modelled in
    the paper.\

16. Discussion: "A robust and multi-criteria optimization framework is
    needed to ensure that their value to society is not compromised by
    optimizing financial returns for the investors." -- as per earlier
    comments this should ideally be part of the model in this paper.
