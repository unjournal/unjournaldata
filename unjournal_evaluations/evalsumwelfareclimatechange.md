# Abstract 

We organized two evaluations of the paper: \"A Welfare Analysis of
Policies Impacting Climate Change\". Both evaluators are strongly
positive about this research. According to the first evaluator
(Emmerling) the papers' main claims include a \"clear ranking of
climate-oriented policies\", and the paper's results "are immediately
very relevant for policymakers when deciding to implement or abandon
given policies." Both offer substantive suggestions. Evaluator 2
(Venmans) provides several requests for clarification and emphasis,
which may be particularly useful for policy-oriented readers less
familiar with the MVPF public economics framework. To read these
evaluations, please see the links below.

# **Overall ratings**

We asked evaluators to provide overall assessments as well as ratings
for a range of specific criteria. * *

**I. Overall assessment **(See footnote[^1])

**II. Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^2]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Evaluation summaries

## Johannes Emmerling

This is an excellent paper that makes significant contributions to
climate policy evaluation. The authors\' application of the MVPF
framework to analyze 96 US environmental policies provides valuable
insights that traditional cost-per-ton metrics often miss. The key
contribution is to develop and meticulously apply the MVPF framework to
a wide range of policies, that take into account all impacts on
individuals and the public. This approach gives a very nice sufficient
statistic in the overall efficiency of a wide range of policies, and
allows \[one to\] easily ... compare and combine different policies.
Also while the approach is marginal, it seems fairly well to \[also\]
allow... for non-marginal policies (albeit this point would be good to
illustrate and demonstrate more clearly). Besides specific points, one
thing I also wonder is whether the "efficiency" from a social point of
view of policies could also be compared across revenue generating and
costing policies. For example, consider a MVPF of 1.5 for a subsidy vs.
0.5 for a tax: would these be considered similar in terms of social
efficiency (as they differ similarly from 1 and zero, respectively)? But
maybe using an average MVPF of revenues one would normalize all policies
so they have the same "scale" in that overall efficiency can be measures
on the same side of unity. But this is more of a suggestion or comment.\
\
Finally \[...\] the framework starts out generally across individuals
(and generations) indexed by i. One issue that I find missing is the
distributional implications or heterogeneity effects. While it is at
some points alluded to (and explicitly when taking the mean of marginal
income or consumption), it would be good to indicate assumptions (and
where relevant, whether this has been considered in the underlying
studies) about distributional incidence. For instance, for EV subsidies
it depends largely if uptake is mostly by rich households (potentially
compared to a representative population, or poorer households). I don't
mean to add this in the analytics but discuss assumptions and the issue
where relevant.

## Frank Venmans 

Under which policy does a dollar of subsidy create the largest impact on
welfare? Similarly, under which environmental tax does a dollar
collected \[...\] create the lowest impact on welfare? The paper answers
these questions by developing the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF).
This allows \[one\] to rank government policies according to their
welfare impacts while respecting a given government budget.  \
\
The authors convincingly claim that their measure of the MVPF allows for
a better ranking of public policies compared to standard measures of
cost per tonne, be it the Resource cost per tonne, Government cost per
tonne or Social cost per tonne. This is because the MVPF includes the
role of inframarginal transfers which are \[an\] important part of
policies, often of larger magnitude than the externalities that the
policies correct for.\
\
The strong point of the paper is to make the different components of the
impacts of a policy additive and easy to distinguish. The paper builds
on a very large body of literature, and builds on causal inference of
the 18 most relevant economics journals (general interest journals and
environmental economics journals).\
\
The paper has also a novel way of estimating the social value of
learning by doing, in a way that requires very \[few\] parameters. This
makes it very policy-relevant. Overall, the paper does an extremely good
job in giving an overview of all the effects of environmental policies
over the last decades.\

# Evaluation manager's discussion (Ben Balmford)

"A Welfare Analysis of Policies Impacting Climate Change" offers a
pioneering application of the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF)
framework to understanding the relative merits of climate related
policy. Both evaluations are extremely positive, and highlight the
utility of the paper for shaping policy responses. Broadly, this is
driven by the fact that moving to MVPF rankings of different policy
options allows policymakers to better assess options given the
real-world constraints they face on budgets, and the wider impacts of
policies through transfer effects. Both evaluators recognise the merit
of this approach as compared with more common approaches to date. While
there are numerous suggestions for ways to improve the paper, these are
broadly about the exposition of the paper. As evaluator 1 suggests, a
clear priority for further developing this agenda is in accounting for
distributional impacts of policies, particularly as these can be so
different across climate measures.

## Issues meriting further evaluation[^22]

Most of the issues we mentioned in our managers' notes to the evaluators
(see Google Doc
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fp-Qi2Z0nRSdU2dmQVGsAhOpvwrUDQ1QXMjSFHO2jyM/edit?usp=sharing "null"))
could use further consideration. These include \
**T**he sensitivity of the marginal value of public funds (MVPF)
estimates to alternative assumptions regarding the social cost of carbon
(SCC), the generalizability of peer effects observed in specific
contexts to other interventions and settings, publication bias, whether
the MVPF framework fully accounts for inframarginal benefits, and issues
of data and sample selection.

# Unjournal process notes

## Why we chose this paper

*From our internal notes:*

> The synthesis/standardisation of a whole bunch of papers reporting
> impacts of various climate change policies could be very useful from
> an impact standpoint, particularly their ability to say something
> about heterogeneity.

> \[Important\] implications for the allocation of resources to mitigate
> climate change. 
>
> The paper attempts to translate results on the impact of multiple
> climate policies into a common measure---the marginal value of public
> funds. 
>
> In doing so, the results of this paper are likely to be interpreted as
> "what we should do more of" as well as "what we should do less of". It
> is almost surely important, then, to evaluate the strength of the key
> results of the paper.

## Author engagement

The authors declined to respond to these evaluations, but noted they may
wish to do so at a later date.

[^1]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have
    encountered in the last three years." We requested they "consider
    all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge
    production, and importance to practice.

[^3]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^4]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^5]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\
    \
    This was on the newer form only

[^6]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^7]: The Marginal Value of Public Funds is not new, it exists in Public
    Economics, but the application to environmental economics is
    innovative.

[^8]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and their
    underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to be
    robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided bias
    and questionable research practices?

[^9]: Evaluating the welfare effects of environmental policies is
    intrinsically hard and will always come with large uncertainty
    intervals. Yet the paper does a very good job at synthesizing and
    reinterpreting the best information we have.

[^10]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^11]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^12]: Replicability has improved quite a bit in the last decade, this
    paper is no exception.

[^13]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^14]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic? Do the authors report results that are relevant to
    practitioners? Do they provide useful quantified estimates (costs,
    benefits, etc.)?"

[^15]: Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?

[^16]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\

[^17]: This is clearly a top field, with some potential for a Top Econ
    one, if the method would be a tad clearer.

[^18]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^19]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^20]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^21]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\
    \

[^22]: Issues that may need further scrutiny, potentially by
    ["independent Unjournal
    evaluators"](https://coda.io/d/_d0KBG3dSZCs/Crowdsourcing-independent-evaluations_sufF1)
    and in future replication and robustness-checking exercises.
