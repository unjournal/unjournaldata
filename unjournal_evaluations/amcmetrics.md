# Preamble

**Paper: **[Advance Market Commitments: Insights from Theory and
Experience](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20201017 "null")
(2020). [@temp_id_09759180848240168]

**Authors: **Michael Kremer, Jonathan Levin, Christopher M. Snyder.

*We organized three evaluations of this paper (1. David Manheim, 2. Dan
Tortorice 3. Joel Tan). To read the evaluations, click the links at the
bottom.*

# **Evaluation Manager's comments (David Reinstein: comments are mainly about the 'process')**

This was among the first papers we considered for The Unjournal
evaluation. We are grateful to the authors of this paper for agreeing to
participate and engage with the Unjournal's evaluation of this paper,
and for following through with this and being very helpful and
supportive. (Although this was first an NBER working paper, it was
selected before we began the "[Unjournal Direct
track](https://bit.ly/unjournaldirect)".)

***Note: ***I also give a general summary of the evaluations and
responses in [this post on the EA
Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FFjk2bJTxu5hsSj6X/unjournal-evals-advance-market-commitments-insights-from "null").

## **Why we chose this paper**

We chose this paper for several reasons. Repeating what I wrote on the
[EA
forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kftzYdmZf4nj2ExN7/what-pivotal-and-useful-research-would-you-like-to-see#1__Kremer_et_al___Advance_Market_Commitments_),
and specifically shared with evaluators.

> Advance market commitments for vaccines and drugs seem highly relevant
> to both global health and development priorities, and to reducing
> catastrophic and/or existential risk from future pandemics. This is
> also a practicable policy.

However, as Evaluator 1 (Manheim) notes, the authors do not specifically
consider 'global catastrophic risks' or extinction risks, or extend
their analyses to these considerations. Perhaps future evaluators
interested in how research relates to these priorities might make
specific suggestions that the authors could respond to. We will work to
encourage and enable more interactive dialogue between authors and
evaluators.

The authors' fairly-detailed engagement with this evaluation confirms
this.

We did not end up pushing to get the authors or evaluators to provide
this format. In fact, it was challenging to get evaluators to directly
engage in the data and empirics. (Why? Maybe this demands a particular
set of skills, it may be labor-intensive and seen to have greater
reputational risks than rewards? We hope to do better to enable this
work going forward, including working with robustness-replication
initiatives.)

## **'What sort of reviewers, and what to ask them?'**

We were looking for evaluators:

1.  With policy expertise:

-   Familiarity with GAVI and AMCs

-   Who can assess 'whether the authors have a reasonable understanding
    of the feasibility of this' and 'are the strategic considerations
    they highlight relevant/realistic?'

-   Who can identify other policy opportunities

2.  And/or who could assess:

-   Choices made in inferring the effect relative to counterfactual:
    E.g., \[is\] Rotavirus a reasonable comparison group?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   the Cost-effectiveness model: "PCV saved 700,000 lives at a highly
    favorable cost" -- consider the components of this model and its
    robustness (perhaps a MonteCarlo Fermi)?

Evaluators were asked to follow the general guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators).
They were also provided with [these additional resources specific to
this
paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vuB9GtmuqCB3O92t3ccmXzh4qNDEua-hsLBdr67G0ho/edit#heading=h.skg5o7h1vzxe),
rationale for its selection, and an 'editorial' first pass of aspects of
the paper to consider.

## The third evaluator (Joel Tan) was given a specific request[^1]:

### Overlooked replication package, lessons learned

***However,*** we both overlooked that the authors had provided [this
replication
package](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117622/version/V1/view)
as a supplement to their AER Papers and Proceedings publication. In our
correspondence with Joel, we had originally linked the NBER version of
the paper, and thus Joel did not notice this package.

We asked Joel whether this would have made a difference, and how he
would follow up on this work if he had more time. His response:

> It would definitely have valuable.... I imagine the basic thing I
> would want to do is double-check the spreadsheet - I highly doubt
> we\'ll get anything like Reinhart/Rogoff, but it would have been

> is robust against other comparator classes anyway, such that the
> replicator spreadsheet doesn\'t help per se.

*More work and how to make it happen:* This makes sense to me. I agree
that there is more work to be done here. This work can be
time-consuming, requires technical skill and field-understanding, and
may not be glamorous. At the Unjournal, we are exploring ways to link
with other projects such as the [Institute for
Replication](https://i4replication.org/), to provide incentives and
environments for robustness-checking, sensitivity analysis, and
policy-relevant extrapolation.\
\
*On the data and code:* I personally lean towards a 'replicable code and
data' approach, preferably using dynamic documents and 'literate code',
rather than relying on spreadsheets. It is easier to adjust, to
interpret, to spot mistakes, and to build on. OSF,
[BITSS](https://www.bitss.org/resource-library/?_sft_resource_tag=dynamic-documents-and-coding-practices#search-filter-results-8443),
and the [Turing
Way](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/website)
project, among others, offer good resources for this

*Looking for the data and packages.* This also teaches us a lesson: when
doing replication, robustness, and extrapolation work we need to check
carefully to be sure to access all available resources provided by
authors. These are sometimes only found in appendices and supplements to
the most recent and formally published version of a paper, where,
thankfully, journals like those associated with the American Economic
Association are now enforcing [data and code availability
policies](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy), with
the help of a dedicated data editor. But our bibliometric systems could
be improved as well -- where replication packages are available, these
could be made more prominent and better linked to the places people are
likely to be reading the paper.

      This was a review, not intended to directly advance knowledge. To the extent that it claims additional usefulness of AMCs, it seems not to have addressed other options.

      While AMCs are a critical tool for global health, and should be used more widely, other approaches which are not discussed seem more appropriate for the most critical future biological risks.

    I noted that this should be done even though the paper was already
    published, albeit in the AER P&P, a journal that is not peer
    reviewed in the standard way. ... so this is not really a prediction
    that can be tracked (as I think the authors cannot resubmit the same
    work to another journal after it's been published in AER P&P.) They
    did not give a 'where *should* it be published' measure.
