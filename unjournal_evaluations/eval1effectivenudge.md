# Abstract 

This is an absolutely superb paper tackling a hugely important policy
question. The authors develop a new econometric approach to aggregating
high-dimensional factorial designs in RCTs in order to identify the most
effective policies, and apply it to the question of increasing childhood
immunization rates. I am thoroughly impressed by every aspect of this
paper: the dataset used, the specific treatment arms used, the policy
relevance, and the approach to identifying the best policy.

# Summary Measures[^1]

We asked evaluators to give some overall assessments, in addition to
ratings across a range of criteria. *See the *[*evaluation summary

for a more detailed breakdown of this. See these ratings in the context
of all Unjournal ratings, with some analysis, in our *[*data

**Overall assessment: **We asked evaluators to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **"On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in? (See

# Written report

This is an absolutely superb paper tackling a hugely important policy
question. The authors develop a new econometric approach to aggregating
high-dimensional factorial designs in RCTs in order to identify the most
effective policies, and apply it to the question of increasing childhood
immunization rates. I am thoroughly impressed by every aspect of this
paper: the dataset used, the specific treatment arms used, the policy
relevance, and the approach to identifying the best policy. The overall
takeaways of the paper are not only of particular policy relevance but
also provide key insight into the economics of reminders.

A key strength of this paper relative to other papers in immunization is
the outcome dataset. Most papers use parents' self-reports of
vaccination status, whereas this paper critically creates a new
administrative database to accurately record immunization activity in
both treatment and control. This is particularly important when
evaluating treatments such as reminders because when parents self-report
vaccinations, this kind of treatment may impact reporting itself
irrespective of latent treatment effects on actual immunization

Banerjee et al. (2010)[@temp_id_20524686987474228] is one of the most
important and influential papers in this literature, illustrating the
efficacy of incentives in increasing immunization rates. Another
component of this current paper which I found very compelling was that
it examines the key policy questions that remained following the results
of that initial paper regarding the level of incentives over the course
of the immunization course.

Another major gap in the literature that this paper addresses is on the
role of SMS campaigns in preventative health. There is wide variation in
the treatment effects from these types of messages, and it has thus far
been unclear as to the reason why: is it necessary to have a famous
Nobel Laureate deliver the message via video, for instance, as was done
by some of the authors during COVID? One natural explanation for the
heterogeneity in treatment effects is that SMS messages exhibit the kind
of complementarity that is at the core of this design.

This paper is also impressive in the scope of its applicability. Not
only is Haryana a huge state with many unvaccinated children, but the
interventions are easily applicable to other states in India, and in
fact other low-income countries. With the near universality of mobile
phones across the developing world, there is no particular aspect of
this treatment that does not apply to other settings. What's more, even
if there is a concern, the overall econometric method here is certainly
portable, so even if the specific method for selecting ambassadors, for
instance, needs to be modified given constraints on surveying from a
census, tweaks on any specific arm can be easily incorporated into a
near-replication of this study.

My only real feedback is that I think the point that the authors make
that immunization is so cost-effective, it is still probably the best
use of money to fight childhood disease even if there are many payments
to inframarginal households, should probably be emphasized more and
earlier on (perhaps in the introduction), as that really shapes what the
bottom line take-away is about the best policy from this paper.
Relatedly, the question of whether there may be long-run persistence in
these policies is in some ways not especially relevant: even if there is
zero persistence year to year within a village (which for the record I
doubt), it is still so cheap relative to the benefit of immunization
that these policies are well worth it.
