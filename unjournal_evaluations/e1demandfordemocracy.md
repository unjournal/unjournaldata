# Abstract 

Why authoritarian leaders continue to receive support despite openly
agitating against democratic institutions is one of the most important
puzzles of the last few decades. This paper argues that the answer is
partly lack of knowledge about the costs of authoritarianism. Using an
online and a field experiment, the authors show that informational
treatments that remedy this lack of knowledge can have substantial
effects on both beliefs and voting behavior.

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

Voters' support for authoritarian regimes comes in part from their lack
of knowledge about the costs of authoritarianism. Informational
interventions that remedy this can have a substantial impact on vote
shares (to the tune of 0.8 pp).

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above? {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

I strongly believe it.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^5] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

The outcome measure should not be post-treatment means but the
difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment. Otherwise, I think
there are sufficient robustness checks.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^6] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

The most important implication of the paper's findings concerns
canvassing efforts of opposition parties is semi-authoritarian regimes:
small changes in their messaging (i.e. talking about scientific
consensus on the importance of press freedom and other democratic
institutions) can dramatically improve their effectiveness. This would
come at little to no additional cost.

# Written report

Turkey, Russia, and Hungary experienced substantial falls in various
democracy indices as their leaders, Erdogan, Putin, and Orban,
dismantled democratic institutions over the last three decades. Still,
they receive strong support from large swaths of their respective
publics, handily winning mostly free --- though unfair --- elections.
They are by no means alone. Much of the democratic world is experiencing
a backlash against democratic, majoritarian, and inclusive institutions.
For academics, this presents a frustrating puzzle: despite robust
evidence in favor of democracy --- not only purely as a system of
governance, but the economic growth it and its bedfellows bring --- why
would voters support parties that want to dismantle it?

This paper tests a simple, albeit understudied, answer to this question:
not everyone has read *Why Nations Fail*. Using an online and a field
experiment, the authors show that a simple informational treatment that
informs voters about the state of democracy and press freedom in Turkey
and their importance in good governance can have dramatic effects on
votes --- expressed intentions for the online experiment and
neighborhood level vote shares for the field experiment. "Dramatic"
here, if anything, is an understatement: the estimated change is a 4.4
percent increase in the vote share of the opposition. Neither the
turnout intentions in the online experiment nor the actual turnout shows
significant changes: not a surprise given the high turnout rates in
Turkey. The authors show that the largest changes happened for
respondents and neighborhoods with the largest misconceptions (in favor
of the government), which they interpret as evidence that the effect is
via persuading government supporters that maybe the costs of keeping
Erdogan in power is larger than they think. They also find that the
effectiveness of the treatment depends on the reliability of the message
(e.g. citations, referring to a scientific consensus) as well as the
affiliation of the canvasser (i.e. partisan or non-partisan), but not so
much on the complexity of the message.

This is an excellent paper that asks an important question, offers a
reasonable answer, and provides credible evidence in its favor. The work
done, especially for the field experiment, is impressive. The analyses
are well-done and very accessible. I have a few concerns and
suggestions, but none of them are major.

**\["A more robust discussion of the studies' ethics is
warranted"\]**[^7]

I would like the authors to elaborate more on the ethics of the
experiments. The estimated effects are large enough ex ante to change
the outcome (although ex post we know they didn't). Currently, the only
discussion is that the authors reached out to all major parties (but
only the opposition responded, which is not surprising given the
content) and that the opposition parties were planning to canvas anyway
and the authors just helped improve the message. I think a more robust
discussion of the studies' ethics is warranted. There is an extensive
literature in both political science and economics that focuses on the
ethics of experiments, in particular regarding election interference.
The paper should refer to such studies and justify its interventions.
That the present intervention is purely informational is insufficient as
a justification: as scientists we tend to agree with the scientific
method and the ensuing consensus --- others may describe the treatments
in this experiment as propaganda. Consider the flip-side of this
experiment: AKP canvassers can cite information from a pro-government
think tank that finds press freedom in Turkey has improved dramatically
to improve their vote shares. Would we then have a "hopeful
interpretation---accurate and high-quality information can bridge gaps
between ideologically divided communities of voters" (p. 25)?

**\[Use of post-treatment values as outcomes; ex-ante differences\]**

My second point is methodological. Both experiments use as their outcome
variables the post-treatment observations: beliefs or voting intentions
in the online experiment and vote shares in the field experiment. Both
experiments also have some imbalance. I am concerned about the ex ante
differences in the outcome variables between the control and the
treatment groups. This concern is exacerbated by what the authors write
on page 19, subsection 4.6: "the magnitudes of the informational
treatment become somewhat smaller when we control for the pre-treatment
values of the dependent variables on the right-hand side of the
regression." Why is not the specification where the pre-treatment values
are controlled for the main specification? This is done in the field
experiment, but not the online experiment. Even better, why don't the
authors use the difference between post- and pre-treatment values
instead of only the post-treatment values. This would be straightforward
for the online experiment; I concede that I see no obvious way of doing
this for the field experiment.

**\[Calculate persuasion rates\]**

Third, and related to the above, I would like the authors to calculate,
if possible, the persuasion rates of their treatment (DellaVigna and
Kaplan, 2007)[@ny0kchivv1h]. A number of papers in this literature
calculate this quantity and it would be very helpful in comparing the
findings here to other contexts and interventions.

**Minor**, but I don't know what "reached tertiary education" (p. 17)
means. Please clarify whether this refers to any post-completion, or
another threshold.

[^2]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have
    encountered in the last three years." We requested they "consider
    all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge
    production, and importance to practice.

[^4]: The evaluator was given the following instructions: Identify the
    most important and impactful factual claim this research makes --
    e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^5]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^6]: *We asked:* \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of
    the above claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do
    you \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy
    choices? Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the
    evaluation manager in some cases. As an example of an
    \'implication\' \... in a global health context, the \'main claim\'
    might suggest that a vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up,
    would save lives at a \$XXXX per life saved.
