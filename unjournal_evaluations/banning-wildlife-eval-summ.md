# Preamble

**Paper:** "Banning wildlife trade can boost demand for unregulated
threatened species" ([@temp_id_37158865398727936]).

**Authors: **Takahiro Kubo, Taro Mieno, Shinya Uryu, Saeko Terada, Diogo
Veríssimo

We organized two evaluations of this paper. To read these evaluations,
please click the links at the bottom.

## Evaluation manager's notes 

**Why we chose this paper**

This paper was submitted by the authors directly to *The Unjournal*. We
selected it from the list of submitted papers due to its topicality, use
of rigorous counterfactual methods for impact evaluation, and the policy
implications of the findings - that conservation policies, such as trade
bans, can lead to negative spillover effects. The implication is clearly
highlighted by the authors: conservation policies should be designed and
implemented in ways that minimize such spillovers.

**How we chose the evaluators**

For this paper, we organized two evaluations. The evaluators were chosen
based on their research and policy expertise relating to wildlife trade;
we also selected evaluators who could assess the technical aspects of
the research, and provide in-depth feedback that might help improve the
design and/or clarity of the analysis.

Evaluators were asked to follow the general guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators).
In addition to written evaluations (similar to journal peer review), we
ask evaluators to provide [quantitative
metrics](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators "null")
on several aspects of each article. These are put together below. For
this paper, we did not give specific suggestions on 'which aspects to
evaluate'.

**Summary of evaluations**

The evaluations are very positive overall. However, both evaluators
suggested that more detail about the SDID method would help the reader
understand the process and interpret the results. In addition, the
process \[the authors used\] to select spillover and control species
would benefit from more clarity, and it would be good if the authors
could clarify how they decided that spillover effects would not also
affect the trade of control species.

**Authors' response to the evaluations**

The authors have welcomed the evaluators' comments and suggestions, and
addressed each of these thoughtfully and rigorously. This has led to
additions and changes made to the paper, although these are not
currently available - however, the authors will update their article
once the next iteration has been completed.
