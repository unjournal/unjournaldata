# Abstract 

*\[AI Generated summary of the evaluation.\]* Bruers (2023) proposes a
novel survey-based approach to quantifying the external welfare cost of
farmed animals by eliciting individuals' willingness to pay or accept
experiencing an animal's life in a hypothetical dream scenario. In
contrast with Kuruc and McFadden (2023) and Espinosa (2024), who rely on
parametric assumptions regarding utility or on animal welfare scoring
frameworks, Bruers' method avoids explicit functional forms and
interspecies welfare comparisons, though it risks higher
anthropocentrism and uncertainty. Survey results from Flemish-speaking
Belgians suggest that most perceive intensively farmed animal lives as
not worth living and would demand compensation to endure them, implying
a recognized negative net welfare for conventionally farmed animals.
Despite the method's innovative setup and potential policy relevance,
the author highlights substantial limitations---hypothetical bias, large
outliers, participants' limited knowledge of rearing conditions, and the
unusual nature of imagining another species' life---that render the
exact monetary estimates unreliable. Nonetheless, the paper underscores
the challenges of valuing nonhuman welfare and enriches the ongoing
discussion about practical, comprehensive ways to incorporate animal
welfare costs into policy analyses. \[End of AI-generated content\][^1]

# Written report

## **Overall assessment**

This paper investigates a method to value the welfare externalities
imposed on farmed animals in monetary terms. At the time the paper was
written (2022), the field of animal welfare economics had only started
investigating this issue, and only two other methods had been proposed.
On one side, Kuruc and McFadden (cited as a working paper, ultimately
published in 2023)[@kuruc_monetizing_2023] proposed estimating the
externalities of human diets on animal welfare by adapting a DICE model.
The authors assumed a CRRA utility function for humans and calibrated
their social welfare function such that a human life below the poverty
line (adjusted for purchasing power) would decrease social welfare.
Monetized animal welfare was computed by assuming the same utility
function for animals and the same contribution to social welfare and by
arbitrarily setting the utility of animals on the CRRA utility function.

In contrast, Espinosa (cited as a working paper, ultimately published in
2024)[@espinosa_animals_2024] proposed a distinct parametric welfare
function for animals using the Five Freedom framework. The Five Freedom
Fulfilment Index consists of a welfare score based on the intensity of
infringement of an animal's freedoms that can be interpreted as a
QALY-like utility function. For each of the Five Freedoms, the author
defined possible levels of impairment (ranging from 'no violation' to
'very severe violations') with associated 'violation points' (from 0 to
4). The welfare score is defined as a linear transformation of the total
number of violation points, rescaled such that the maximum score of 1
corresponds to a life without freedom violation and score of 0
corresponds to a life that is neither worthy nor unworthy of being
lived. Monetized animal welfare was then computed by weighting the
QALY-like utility scores of an animal by a utility potential (based on
the relative number of cortical neurons compared to humans) and by
multiplying it by the social monetary valuation of a human QALY (as
humans have by definition a utility potential of 1).

Bruers (2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] emerged as a third concomitant
proposal to economically value animal welfare. The paper starts from the
idea that animals, while having preferences, cannot express
willingness-to-pay (WTP) or willingness-to-accept (WTA) related to
changes that could affect their welfare status. Policymakers and social
planners thus lack appropriate measures to estimate the welfare impact
of a policy on animals (measures that we could use in benefit-cost
analyses for instance). To address this problem, the author proposes to
elicit humans' WTP/WTA to experience an animal's life (focusing on
farmed animals). He argues that these outcomes reflect the external
animal welfare costs, i.e., the welfare burden imposed on animals, which
is distinct from the altruistic concerns that humans experience when
they impact animals. In this setup, a positive WTP to avoid experiencing
an animal's life would reflect the belief that a farmed animal's life is
not worth living.

The strategy proposed by Bruers (2023)[@bruers_animal_2023]
significantly differs from Kuruc and McFadden
(2023)[@kuruc_monetizing_2023] and Espinosa
(2024)[@espinosa_animals_2024], with pros and cons. On the one side,
Bruers (2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] does not need to make parametric
assumptions about the utility functions of humans or animals. In
contrast, Kuruc and McFadden (2023)[@kuruc_monetizing_2023] assumed a
CRRA utility function for both humans and animals. Espinosa (2024) also
remained agnostic about the shape of the utility function for humans,
but his original version of the Five Freedom Fulfilment Index imposed
significant structure (linearity assumption). In addition, Bruers
(2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] does not need to make any assumption about
the highly complex question of interspecies welfare comparison (i.e.,
how to compare utils across species). Kuruc and McFadden
(2023)[@kuruc_monetizing_2023] remain silent on the issue (i.e., they
only consider a 'political' weight parameter about the importance to
socially give to animal welfare), while Espinosa
(2024)[@espinosa_animals_2024] weighs utility points by utility/welfare
potentials, building on the idea of Spears and Budolfson
(2019)[@budolfson_quantifying_2019]. On the other side, the weaker
structure imposed by Bruers (2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] comes at the
cost of larger risks of anthropocentrism and, thus, larger uncertainty
about the estimates. Lay people might \[also\] lack the appropriate
knowledge about the welfare of the animals and current rearing
conditions in their country.

The main differences between the three approaches are summarized in the

From a theoretical perspective, the author derives three types of
WTP/WTA. First, he expresses the WTP for meat consumption as the amount
of money (or, more precisely, a composite good) that would make him
indifferent between his current situation with meat consumption and an
alternative situation where he would stop eating meat but would receive
this amount of money. Second, the author defines the marginal WTP for
animal welfare (altruistic component) as the maximum amount of money an
agent is willing to spend to increase the welfare of an animal by one
unit \[one utility point\]. Third, the external cost of the welfare
burden imposed on animals is defined as the change in an agent's
endowment that would make him indifferent between (i) experiencing only
his life with the reduced/augmented endowment and (ii) experiencing both
his life (with the original endowment) and the animal's life.

To estimate these compensating variations, the author developed a survey
administered in June 2022 to a sample (N=500) of the Flemish-speaking
Belgians aged 18 to 65. The sample was demographically representative
for  age and gender. However, due to the exclusion criteria, the final
sample shrunk to N=301 respondents. In this hypothetical survey, the
respondent is asked to imagine taking a pill that would make him sleep
and live the life of an animal. In this dream, he would experience the
entire life of the animal, the same way the animal does (e.g., similar
sensory capacities, similar cognition). When waking up, he would not
remember this experience. The alternative consists of taking a pill that
would induce a dreamless sleep of equal duration.

The author estimates the external cost imposed on animal welfare by
eliciting the WTP/WTA for the two pills. He first asks which pill the
respondent would prefer taking and then elicits either a WTP for the
preferred pill or a WTA for the other pills (WTP or WTA condition,
random assignment with equal probability at the respondent level). The
author then reports absolute WTP/WTA for pills under various scenarios
(conventional farming, intensive farming, label-certified farming,
neutral life, and happiest possible life) and relative WTP/WTA (absolute
WTP/WTA minus the WTP/WTA for the animal's neutral life). The latter
aims to control for the (dis)utility of experiencing an animal's life,
whatever the welfare state at stake. Next, the author attempts to
approximate the WTP for marginal animal welfare improvement by eliciting
the participants' WTP to replace one kilogram of conventional meat with
one kilogram of cultured meat (for three types of meat -chicken, pig,
cow-, displayed in random order). The author also elicits expectations
about the WTP for cultured meat of other Belgian citizens as an attempt
to mitigate possible social desirability biases. 

The author finds that most of the participants give a positive WTA for
conventionally farmed animals, indicating that they would need to be
compensated to experience a farmed animal's life and, thus, that the
animal's life is seen as not worth living. This result holds for
chickens, pigs, and cows. Consistently, people are more and more willing
to accept experiences of animal lives when welfare is larger (chicken
with better life or maximum welfare scenarios). The author finds
positive WTP for cultured meat, which he interprets as positive
altruistic preferences towards animals, but detects no statistically
significant correlations between one's WTP for cultured meat and one's
WTA/WTP for experiencing the life of the animal of the associated
cultured product.

The author recognizes several important limits with his work.[^3] He
underlines the issues associated with data attrition due to the
exclusion criteria. Indeed, about two-fifths of the sample were excluded
from the analysis either because they reported inconsistent answers
(e.g., larger WTP to avoid the life of the happiest animal than to avoid
the lower-welfare lives), reported unrealistic WTA (i.e., more than one
million Euros), or reported low confidence levels in their answers.
Regarding the latter, the author underlines the large sensitivity in the
results depending on whether less-confident respondents are included or
excluded from the analysis. He also mentions that respondents might
misperceive or misestimate the welfare status of currently farmed
animals in their country. He is also concerned about the presence of
large outliers in the WTPs, which might originate from hypothetical bias
issues. He then concludes that this survey approach might represent a
difficult tool to estimate the external costs imposed on animal welfare.

**Claims, strength, and characterization of evidence**

Bruers (2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] proposes a neat and clever design to
discuss the issue of the quantification of animal welfare. At the time
of the writing, the community was (and still is) looking at the most
appropriate way to express animal welfare in monetary terms. Bruers'
approach avoids some of the drawbacks of concomitant alternative
methods. In Kuruc and McFadden (2023)[@kuruc_monetizing_2023] the
relative position of the animals on the welfare utility function was
somewhat arbitrary. While Espinosa (2024)[@espinosa_animals_2024]
assessed animal welfare using an animal welfare function, the parametric
assumptions are also important limits. Bruers
(2023)[@bruers_animal_2023] does not suffer from these issues: By
estimating the WTP/WTA of humans to live a farmed animal's life, the
author avoids needing to impose any parametric assumptions on either the
humans' or the animals' utility functions.

This paper significantly contributes to the discussion on animal welfare
valuation by showing some limits of anthropocentric valuation including
his own approach.[^4] The author recognizes that his method is not
reliable to obtain accurate estimates of the welfare of animals.
However, it makes a great contribution by underlining the numerous
issues that make such approaches unreliable  (e.g., the perception of
the animal's capacity to experience the world, the perception of the
animal's farming conditions, hypothetical biases, outliers, and
exclusion criteria).[^5]

While the numbers themselves must be interpreted with caution, the paper
discusses several elements that will be valuable for future research.
First, it shows that most participants would like to avoid experiencing
the life of currently farmed animals. This suggests that people may
generally acknowledge that most of these lives are not worth living and
even worth avoiding. The author concludes that his evidence aligns well
with previous findings in the literature (e.g., Espinosa and Treich
2021)[@espinosa_animal_2021]. While the point estimates might be
unreliable for policy purposes, the results indicate that there could be
a social consensus on the fact that reducing intensive farming would be
beneficial. Second, from a more practical side, the author underlines
how difficult it is to make a definitive conclusion about what society
or the representative citizen thinks about this. Indeed, the author
finds large differences between the mean and median estimates of WTA/WTP
to experience an animal's life, which reflects the large heterogeneity
in views on the topic (i.e., some people have very negative perceptions
of the animals' welfare),  and, possibly, the substantial heterogeneity
in the comprehension of the survey (e.g., familiarity with the concepts
involved or with the quantification/monetization tasks).

One major source of caution concerns the interpretation of the results
related to the marginal altruistic WTP. This quantity is approximated
through the WTP for the replacement of one kilogram of conventional meat
supply with one kilogram of cultured meat. However, it is unclear
whether the cultured-meat WTP effectively reflects altruistic
preferences. For instance, consumers could expect the quality to differ
between the two products, they could be reluctant to try new food (*food
neophobia)*, they could hold naturalistic views about food (i.e., a
reluctance against food tech), etc. At the altruistic level, individuals
could also think that cultured meat would prevent the birth of some
animals, which, even if their net lifetime welfare is negative, would
not be socially desirable.[^6] 

**Methods: Justification, reasonableness, validity, robustness**

Within the limits that the author himself recognizes, and with the
exception of the cultured meat questions, the methods are valid,
reasonable, and well-justified. From a theoretical perspective, the
measure of the human's perception of the welfare of the animal is well
defined: it corresponds to the change in private endowment that makes
the human indifferent between living and not living the animal's life on
top of his own life. From an empirical perspective, the author estimates
it by considering several challenges, including (i) that some
participants might have positive or negative perceptions of the welfare
of the animal (i.e., the author uses a first-stage question to elicit
the preferred pill), (ii) WTA/WTP framing might alter the results, (iii)
outliers could lead to extremely high average WTP/WTA, (iv) some
participants might have very low confidence in this unusual exercise,
and (v) there might be some intrinsic (dis)utility in living an animal's
life.

The work also contains numerous limitations, and most of them are
recognized by the author himself. The main (and most standard)
limitation is the hypothetical nature of the survey: participants do not
face real incentives, which might lead to underestimating or
overestimating the welfare burden of our diet imposed on animals. One of
the most intrinsic limits concerns the difficulty for lay people (and
humans in general) to project themselves into the lives of animals of
other species. One can be indeed ignorant about the needs, the
perception of the world, the cognition, etc. of other species, such that
estimating their welfare is a daunting task. In addition, humans can
also be ignorant about the rearing conditions in "conventional" farms,
making the estimates even more uncertain. Ultimately, the layers of
complexity (unusual survey, ignorance about other species, uncertainty
about rearing conditions) add up and make the point estimates hard to
rely on.

**Advancing knowledge and practice**

The paper brings valuable insight into the broader research question of
how to get monetary valuations of animal welfare using the tools and
approaches of economics.

**Logic and communication**

The paper is well-written and easy to understand both for academics and
less-specialized readers.

**Open, collaborative, replicable science**

I did not find an online repository for data and code.[^7]

**Relevance to global priorities, usefulness for practitioners**

Because the author recognizes that the method might not be reliable for
empirical estimation, the usefulness might be limited for practitioners
(other than to prevent them from replicating such approaches).

The paper has a high relevance to global priorities given the prevalence
of animal factory farming nowadays.

    This evaluation assesses Bruers\' (2023) method for valuing animal
    welfare externalities by eliciting human willingness-to-pay (WTP) or
    willingness-to-accept (WTA) to experience a farmed animal\'s life.
    The study contrasts Bruers\' approach with two others: Kuruc and
    McFadden (2023) who used a CRRA utility function for humans and
    animals, and Espinosa (2024) who used the Five Freedoms framework.
    Bruers\' method avoids making parametric assumptions about utility
    functions or interspecies welfare comparisons, but it is more
    vulnerable to anthropocentrism. The survey, conducted on a sample of
    Flemish-speaking Belgians, found that most participants would need
    to be compensated to experience the life of conventionally farmed
    animals, indicating that these lives are not seen as worth living.
    The evaluation also highlights the limitations of the study such as
    hypothetical bias, data attrition due to exclusion criteria, and the
    challenges of accurately estimating animal welfare using human
    perceptions. The paper concludes that, while the method may not be
    reliable for accurate empirical estimation, it provides valuable
    insight into the difficulties of valuing animal welfare. The
    evaluation also notes that the study author\'s attempt to measure
    marginal altruistic WTP by eliciting WTP for cultured meat may not
    accurately reflect altruistic preferences, due to factors like food
    neophobia and naturalistic views about food.

[^2]: Normally we would require an evaluator to provide at least a core
    set of measures. We made an exception in this case.

[^3]: **Author's Response (Stijn):** I agree \[with these limitations\].
    The sample size is small, but I doubt that a larger sample size
    could mitigate the two major problems:

    -   the discrepancy between WTA and WTP (comparable to an extremely
        large endowment effect), and

    -   the discrepancy between median and mean (i.e. the skewness of
        the distribution).

    The survey questions may be too hypothetical. The animal welfare
    cost of meat could probably be much better estimated with different
    survey methodology, that asks directly about welfare estimates and
    welfare ranges of farmed animals (relative to humans). These welfare
    estimates could be translated in monetary terms using the value of a
    statistical (human) life. See the study Bruers, S. (2025). A Survey
    on Inter-animal Welfare Comparisons. *Journal of Applied Animal
    Ethics Research*, *1*(aop), 1-21.

[^4]: The approach of Bruers (2023) is partially anthropocentric. On the
    one side, it can be considered as anthropocentric as it elicits
    humans' preferences to experience an animal's life. It thus depends
    on human tastes and perceptions of the matter. However, the approach
    is less anthropocentric than standard altruistic WTP studies in the
    sense that it aims at fully intergrating the (perceived) externality
    imposed on animal welfare.   

[^5]: **Author's Response (Stijn):** I think the anthropocentric nature
    is unavoidable: all currently proposed animal welfare estimate
    methodologies contain significant anthropocentrism. A primary
    challenge is how to estimate and avoid biases of meat eaters and
    vegans: meat eaters may underestimate farmed animal suffering, but
    vegans (who are vegan for ethical reasons) may perhaps overestimate
    it. 

[^6]: Authors' response: Yes, I agree with \[this\] criticism: there are
    many confounding factors to measure the marginal WTP using questions
    about cultivated meat. The same goes for hypothetical questions
    about e.g. meat from animals that are genetically programmed to not
    feel any suffering. I don\'t know of another method used in the
    literature that captures the full marginal WTP to avoid all
    suffering of a farmed animal, without confounding elements. As
    animals on animal welfare certified farms still experience some
    non-zero suffering, traditional research methodologies involving WTP
    for animal-welfare-labelled meat do not capture the full WTP to
    avoid all suffering, and also involve confounding factors such as
    the level of trust in the certification scheme.
