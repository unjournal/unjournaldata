# Abstract 

This is an evaluation of \"Accelerating Vaccine Innovation for Emerging
Infectious Diseases via Parallel Discovery\". \[Extract from the
evaluator's summary follows.\] This is an advance on the literature, a
promising foundation for future research. In its current form I do not
find it convincing as a model of the future of vaccine development, and
I am very skeptical of its repeated claims that the portfolio will have
a 66% chance of preventing a major 'Disease X' pandemic, because the
paper does not provide enough information about how it simulates the
development of these vaccines for a previously unknown pathogen.
However, it provides some insight in its current form (it shows that
challenge trials, while potentially helpful, are not sufficient to solve
the problem), and there are several minor extensions that could make it
much more useful.

# Written report[^2]

## **Summary Review**

This is an advance on the literature, a promising foundation for future
research. In its current form I do not find it convincing as a model of
the future of vaccine development, and I am very skeptical of its
repeated claims that the portfolio will have a 66% chance of preventing
a major 'Disease X' pandemic, because the paper does not provide enough
information about how it simulates the development of these vaccines for
a previously unknown pathogen.

However, it provides some insight in its current form (it shows that
challenge trials, while potentially helpful, are not sufficient to solve
the problem), and there are several minor extensions that could make it
much more useful. In particular, Table S1 should be promoted to the main
body of the paper, discussed more, and expanded. This table tells us
what is more or less likely to make a vaccine portfolio happen, and
should be expanded to include more policy choices, such as reforms to
decrease the cost of trials.

## **Specific points:**

### **Modeling Doses**

The doses per outbreak should be a variable, ideally one different for
each disease, rather than fixed at 10 million. For each known emerging
infectious disease, there is a probability that it will become a major
global pandemic, but also a probability that it will be smaller or can
be contained. The following should be researched, possibly via expert
elicitation:

1.  For each disease, what is the 90% CI of the number of vaccine doses
    that would be required to contain the outbreak with a ring
    vaccination approach? For example, the 2018 Kiva Ebola outbreak was
    contained with about 100,000 vaccines.

2.  What is the probability that containment fails and the disease
    becomes a global pandemic?

Much, perhaps most, of the returns are driven by the 'Disease X' vaccine
sales. The paper does not fully explain how this is modeled, but from
what I can see, I suspect that it is wrong to include it in the
portfolio. At minimum, it should include a sensitivity analysis where
the Disease X vaccines are removed from the results.

### **Modeling Disease X**

It seems from Page 13 that the Disease X vaccine is not developed to
completion of phase 2 in the absence of an outbreak. However, the paper
never states how and when the vaccine is developed, and how it relates
to the rest of the portfolio. I suspect that there is a special logic
for an accelerated trial after the Disease X outbreak starts. But if
this is the case, then Disease X should not be included in the
portfolio, because it is a completely separate program and research
track.

A better modeling approach would be to use a viral families approach, as
described by CSET and CHS:

-   <https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/viral-families-and-disease-x-a-framework-for-u-s-pandemic-preparedness-policy/>
    [@temp_id_5703816377459474]

-   <https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/sites/default/files/2022-12/180510-pandemic-pathogens-report.pdf>
    [@adalja2018characteristics]

Disease X is likely to come from one of a small number of vaccine
families. If there is an approved vaccine for another virus in that
family, it will be easier to develop one for Disease X. For example, if
Disease X is a paramyxovirus, and a Nipah vaccine has been approved,
that Nipah vaccine might be effective against Disease X, and it will be
easier to develop and produce a new vaccine specifically for Disease X.

The simulation framework for Disease X should be:

1.  If Disease X happens, randomly choose which viral family it comes
    from.

2.  If there is no vaccine approved or in the pipeline for any disease
    in that family, there is no cash flow from the portfolio, because
    any development will be de novo.

3.  If there is a vaccine in development, or approved, for a disease in
    that family, an expedited development and trial can begin. The
    development of the mpox vaccine can be used as a case study for
    this.

4.  There is a probability that the existing vaccine can be used
    immediately for Disease X (likely with a lower effectiveness, but
    still providing cash flow and social value).

5.  The number of vaccines sold is variable. Some Disease X outbreaks
    may be large, but others may be small, like mpox. (Expand the
    definition and probability of 'Disease X' to account for this larger
    definition, such that there is still a 1% chance of a major
    outbreak.)

### **Modeling Costs**

The cost per dose is key to profitability, but \[this is\] modeled with
little rigor. In the primary specification, they assume a fixed \$20 per
dose based on very little information. They could easily extend the
model to market-based pricing, where a company could charge more if it
has a monopoly and less if there is competition. The simulation should
be upgraded so that if only one vaccine candidate has been successfully
researched, the price is higher. (Even so, Table S1 shows that even with
a price of \$100 per dose, the returns are not high enough to compensate
investors for the risk in the absence of other reforms.)

### **Presentation and Discussion**

The main takeaway from this paper is that we need regulatory reforms to
make vaccine clinical trials cheaper. However, the paper authors have
very little discussion of this, and tend to treat clinical trial costs
as a law of nature rather than a policy choice.

The 'Average Number of Infections' column in Table 1 is extraneous and
misleading, having no impact on the simulation. They always assume that
10 million doses will be sold for all vaccines.

The bin size on Figure 3 is much too large, and the histograms reveal
very little.

### **Extensions**

There are many virus families that are candidates for a Disease X, such
as picornaviruses, that are not associated with the Emerging Infectious
Diseases described in this paper. However, they are associated with
seasonal respiratory viruses, and there may be a market for them. For
example, many schoolteachers might like to take an annual rhinovirus
vaccine. The model should include them.

Vaccines in these virus families will, if successful, generate some
annual cash flow, while also having a chance of being useful against
Disease X.

The cost per clinical trial should be a variable input, and Table S1
should show profitability with lower trial costs. While there may be
some reforms that simply improve efficiency, other reforms may generate
tradeoffs in the form of slightly lower safety and efficacy, and the
costs and benefits of these expedited and cheaper trials can be modeled.
As a first step, however, this simulation can easily show how much
cheaper clinical trials would have to be for the portfolio to be
profitable.
