# Abstract 

The paper presents and interprets the results of a well-powered one-time
unconditional cash transfer experiment for low-income people in the US.
The cash significantly increased recipient spending, but decreased
survey measures of self-assessed wellbeing relative to control.
Participant attrition limits the strength of the conclusions we can draw
from this high-quality study. Overall, the study modestly shifted my
views against one-time transfers and toward other policy tools for
reducing poverty and inequality in wealthy societies.

# Written report

The paper presents and interprets the results of a well-powered one-time
unconditional cash transfer experiment in the US during 2020 and 2021.
The experiment randomly assigned low-income people to receive either
\$2000, \$500, or zero dollars, and then measured various outcomes pre-
and post-treatment using participants' bank data and a four-wave survey
(with one wave being pre-treatment).

The results suggest that \$2000 and \$500 treatments each significantly
increase recipient spending, especially on digital cash transfers and
retail, with no effect on spending on 'harmful' items such as alcohol,
tobacco, or gambling. However, the results also show significant
decreases in the survey measures of financial, psychological, cognitive,
and physical health in the cash groups relative to the control group.

The paper presents its main interpretation of the negative results on
the survey measures using a model that shows that people who 1) have
negatively biased expectations of the size of a negative financial shock
and 2) are induced to monitor their finances more closely due to
receiving a positive financial shock (e.g., the one-time cash transfer
treatments in this study) might end up unhappier than they would have if
they had not received the cash transfer. More concisely, the argument is
that the "unhappy surprise" of learning more about negative shocks to
one's own finances can outweigh the "happy surprise" of receiving the
one-time cash transfer.

Overall, the paper makes a strong contribution to the cash transfer
literature for a number of reasons, including the study's multiple
treatment arms, its geographic context, its timing during the height of
the COVID pandemic, and its measurement of a broad range of outcomes.
The study also has some important limitations, including participant
attrition and challenges in nailing down the mechanism driving the
survey results.

## Attrition

Sample attrition is the main limitation of the study. The Manski bounds
for treatment effects are correspondingly large. As one example, the
lower and upper possible bounds for the treatment effect of the \$2000
transfer on participants' financial health are -1.30 to 1.02,
respectively. Lee (2009) bound coefficients are also wide, with 95% CIs
often approximately \[-0.35, 0.25\]. These are, of course, very
conservative bounding exercises, but they put the main estimates in
helpful context.

While the bounding exercises give pause, the consistently significant
negative estimates after multiple imputation (as proposed in the study's
pre-analysis plan) increase my confidence in the results a bit. Still,
the fact that the treatment effect results are smaller after multiple
imputation is consistent with attrition indeed biasing the paper's main
estimates in a negative direction.

The paper also offers helpful theorization of the mechanisms by which
attrition might bias the results in a negative direction in Section C.4.
Possibilities include things like treated and control individuals having
different baseline conditions, or living in areas that are trending
differently with respect to COVID or economic conditions. There remain
many additional possible mechanisms based on unobservables, but the
evidence presented in this section helps to allay concerns about some of
the more straightforward possibilities for how attrition would
negatively bias the results.

In summary, the paper does a nice job of dealing with attrition as best
it can, but it remains the main obstacle to learning more about the true
treatment effects. I don't have any great insights to offer on this
front, but I hope that more work is done in future studies to find ways
of improving response rates in the field.

## Social Welfare Effects - Self-Assessed Wellbeing

What does this study teach us about policy solutions to poverty and
inequality? In this section I focus on broader interpretations related
to self-assessed wellbeing. This study's results suggest that one-time
unconditional cash transfers are not effective at improving
self-assessed quality of life among poor people *within 15 weeks *(it's
possible, though I would not say likely, that the one-time transfers
positively affected the longer-term wellbeing of treated participants).

However, the social welfare effects of one-time transfers like these
remain ambiguous. As I described earlier, the study argues that the
non-positive effects on self-reported wellbeing stem from treated
individuals being induced to more "actively" monitor their finances,
which leads to "unhappy surprises" about negative shocks to one's
finances that outweigh the "happy surprise" of the one-time cash
transfer. Readers will vary in how normatively good or bad they think
this story is.

Another ambiguity of the broader welfare effects involves network
effects. Treated individuals often shared or spent the money with/on
family and friends, but we don't have measures of self-reported
wellbeing of the friends and families. Section D.6 shows that the
treatment didn't affect respondents' relationships, but only with people
"outside the household." If the paper's main mechanism is correct, then
it is plausible that individuals close to the treated individual get an
indirect version of the "happy surprise" of a one-time cash transfer
while avoiding the "unhappy surprise" of learning about unexpected
negative financial shocks.

Taken together, we still have a lot to learn about the broader effects
of one-time cash transfers on aggregate (self-understood) wellbeing.

## Social Welfare Effects - Reducing Poverty & Inequality

Does this study change my view of one-time cash transfers as a policy
solution to poverty and inequality in wealthy country contexts? It is
worth noting that cash transfers mechanically make people less poor, at
least for some amount of time. The study is limited by its measurement
timeframe, but recipients spent significantly more over the period
(often some months) for which the study has bank account data. These
outcomes reflect important policy goals in and of themselves.

The policy importance of cash transfers matters even if the cash does
not increase recipients' net worth. For example, the new Bartik et al
(2024)[@temp_id_3861004006748463] study has a different treatment
(monthly cash transfers for three years), but finds no effect of the
transfers on net worth because recipients took on more debt (often car
loans) to match their newly increased incomes---but if recipients were
better positioned or freer to access credit after receiving cash
transfers, this would represent a policy success for the many who have
called for greater equality in credit provision across class, race, and
gender. For more discussion of the normative implications of access to
credit and debt, see the work of legal scholar Abbye Atkinson. (It is
also worth noting here that we do not know much about the very long term
effects, on the order of decades, lifetimes, or across generations, of
cash transfers.)

## Conclusion

The "How Effective Is (More) Money?" paper makes a contribution to our
understanding of one-time cash transfers to the poor in wealthy society
contexts. The experimental design was strong, with a well-powered sample
and many important repeated outcome measures. The paper also does a
really nice job squeezing every possible ounce of inference out of the
available data. Respondent attrition and uncertainty about mechanisms
are common in field experiments, and scholars can use this paper as a
guide for how to gauge the size of potential bias in estimates and
adjudicate between potential mechanisms driving unexpected results.

The paper did indeed shift my beliefs about the medium-term effects of
moderately sized one-time cash transfers on self-assessed wellbeing
downward a bit, from an expectation of positive effects toward an
expectation of zero effects. Attrition does weaken the signal conveyed
by the estimates. But there still is a signal. A true positive effect is
still possible in this case, but this would require the respondents who
dropped out of the survey to have pretty exceptionally distinct trends
in self-assessed wellbeing.

In terms of informing policy, this study did not change my views very
substantially on the role of cash transfers as a tool for improving
society. As I described earlier in this review, even a true negative
effect of cash transfers on self-assessed wellbeing could be normatively
offset by the spending effects or if there exist positive network
effects for recipients' family and friends. Cash transfers, both by
giving money to low income families or by financing them through
taxation, can be a tool to reduce economic inequality and the negative
externalities that come with it. Furthermore, current and proposed cash
transfers seem to work well in the US. This study doesn't present direct
evidence against the efficacy of a child tax credit, which, in one new
prominent national proposal in the US, would be a one-time \$6000
transfer. A plethora of difference-in-differences analyses of the Earned
Income Tax Credit, such as those by Hilary Hoynes and her collaborators,
show positive effects on infant and child health, educational outcomes,
future earnings, and even reductions in children's long term chances of
being incarcerated.

However, societies' policy choice is not simply a binary yes or no to
cash transfers. There are other policy tools to increase spending by the
poor and reduce economic inequality, and their trade-offs relative to
cash transfers should be compared. This study's findings modestly shift
my views away from unconditional one-time cash transfers toward other
policy tools that would increase worker bargaining power, like sectoral
bargaining, other welfare state tools that increase redistribution while
also reducing rent extraction, like universal single payer health
insurance, or industrial policy. Still, as global wealth continues to
increase, I see an important role for unconditional cash transfers.
