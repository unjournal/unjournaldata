title: Authors' response to evaluations of "Banning wildlife trade can
  boost demand for unregulated threatened species"
uri: "https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/2ojwctbj"
---

The authors gave a detailed response to each of the specific points
raised by the evaluators. We present these interstitial responses below.
(Recall, the overall evaluation metrics and predictions and and the
evaluation manager's summary can be found
[here](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/banning-wildlife-eval-summ/release/1)).

## Comment by Evaluation Manager (Tanya O'Garra), and authors' response

*The evaluations are positive overall. However, both evaluators suggest
that more detail about the SDID method would help the reader understand
the process and interpret results. In addition, the process engaged in
by the authors to select spillover and control species would benefit
from more clarity, and it would be good if the authors could clarify how
they decided that spillover effects would not also affect the trade of
control species.*

**Response**

We are grateful for the positive opinion from you and the reviewers. We
have updated the description of the SDID method with reference to key
literature. We have also replied to the comments concerning the species
selection process and reported results of several sensitivity analyses
to support our findings. Please see below the responses to the comments
and relevant revisions.

## Written report (Evaluation 1, Jia Huan Liew), and authors' response 

*Note from the Unjournal: As per our policies, the authors were not made
aware of the evaluators identities of the response, even when, as in
this case, the evaluator chose to sign their name.*

**#1-1**

*Kubo et al assessed the possible impacts of wildlife trade bans on
non-target species using an online auction dataset spanning 10-years.
The authors demonstrated spillover effects in the form of increased
trade volume involving closely related species. The spillover effects
differed between the three broad groups studied, leading the authors to
posit that spillover effects may differ as a function of demand for the
banned species, as well as the availability of legal alternatives in the
market. Overall, I thought that this is an interesting and topical paper
that provides important support for anecdotes of unintended negative
outcomes from trade bans. I was also intrigued by the authors'
application of synthetic difference-in-diifferences (SDID) which seemed
a potentially powerful method for assessing the broad effects of policy
decisions.*

*Despite my general appreciation of this work, I feel that the evidence
supporting the authors' overarching conclusion was not presented with
sufficient clarity. This is because the modelling approach is fairly
advanced, yet the details provided were too scant.*

**Response**

Thank you for your positive opinion and helpful comments on the
manuscript. We have now updated the description of the method. Please
see below for details.

**#1-2**

*The most important component of this study, in my opinion, lies in the
authors' selection of "spillover" and "control" species, as I expect
this to be highly influential on SDID outcomes. For "spillover" species,
I recommend the authors better justify their selection by explaining,
from a buyer's point-of-view, why these would be realistic alternatives.
The authors provide strong justification for giant water bugs (i.e.,
same market name), but not for salamanders and freshwater fish.
"Spillover" species for the latter two were close-relatives, which could
be a reasonable choice if the authors cite evidence to establish the
logic that underlie a potential buyer's decision to choose
phylogenetically close alternatives in the event of a ban. As these are
likely to be kept as pets, perhaps other species traits (e.g.,
appearance, size) that may not necessarily be linked to phylogeny may be
more important? To clarify, I do not believe that the authors' approach
is wrong. I do, however, suggest the authors better explain their
selection process.*

**Response**

We appreciate your helpful comment. Since most studies exploring
substitutability in wildlife trade have focused on traditional Chinese
medicine (e.g., [@temp_id_8752952754855803];
[@temp_id_9091081465521433]), it is not possible to conclude that
phylogenetic closeness is the most important factor to judge
substitutability of online wildlife (products) for consumers. However,
we believe that a phylogenetic closeness is an objective index to
describe similarities with the original banned species. That is,
although other traits can be the indexes as you mentioned, this study
supposes that the closer the distance, the greater the likelihood of
substitution than the farther the distance. Also, as the Note S2 in the
SI has explained, the mis-identification does not overestimate the
spillover impacts. It means that, even from the conservative view, the
results of this study show that there are spillover impacts of banning
wildlife trade on the trade of non-banned species. We have updated the
sentence in Discussion by following your suggestion; the text now reads
as follows:

> *As previous studies exploring substitutability in wildlife trade have
> mainly focused on traditional Chinese medicine*^*49*^*, it is not
> possible to judge how well these criteria capture the similarities
> between banned and potential spillover species to consider
> substitutability. However, these procedures concerning criteria
> selection do not overestimate the spillover impacts even if there is
> misassignment concerning species in the SDID models (see Note S2 in
> the SI Appendix for details).* (Ln 281-287)

**#1-3**

*Relatedly, "control" units were defined as "trades in the same
categories as banned species, excluding potential spillover species"
(Page 12, Paragraph 2). This is too vague for readers to follow and
potentially replicate. I could not deduce what the term "categories"
refer to. The identities of top control units were detailed in Fig S2
and Fig S4, but the texts were in Japanese (Fig S2) or too small to read
(S4). From what I could tell, some of the control units were congeners
of the banned salamander species and selected "spillovers". I therefore
wondered about how phylogenetic relatedness of "spillover" species were
ranked and how the authors decided that spillover effects would not also
affect the trade of "control" species.*

**Response**

We have added the explanation of "categories" and updated the text
around "categories". The text reads as follows:

> *Traded categories, such as amphibian, were given by the auction
> website (i.e., https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/list1/0-all.html).* (Ln
> 265-266)
>
> *The control units were the trades in the same categories given by the
> auction website as those of the banned species, excluding those of the
> potential spillover species.* (Ln 291-292)

Also, we have updated Fig S2 and S4 to enlarge the species names. As we
have replied to the comment above (i.e., #1-2), the misidentification
might underestimate but not overestimate the impacts of policy change
(see the response to your comment #1-2 and Note S2 for details).

**#1-4**

*With my admittedly limited understanding of SDID, I am also wondering
if the issues regarding "spillover" and "control" species selection
could have been averted if the authors use an unrelated group of animals
(e.g., turtles) to parameterise their synthetic controls, assuming this
group was not subject to similar bans. This may also help overcome the
potential issue of any spillover effects in the currently selected
"control" units which could obfuscate the estimation of DiD values. If
the appeal of SDID was the allowance for differences in trend between
intervention and control groups before the ban, do control units need to
be close relatives of the spillover species?*

**Response**

The SDID has unique advantages by combining attractive features of
difference-in-differences (DID) and synthetic control (SC). The SDID
reweights and matches pre-exposure trends to make the control time trend
parallel to (policy) treated unit. Therefore, completely unrelated
species are not likely to be controls because selecting unrelated
species does not help to develop (artificial) parallel trends to explore
causal impacts. For details, see Arkhangelsky et al.
([@temp_id_043949734772749105]).

**#1-5**

*I appreciate the novelty of applying SDID, but I am concerned that
there is insufficient context to ease comprehension if this work were to
be submitted to journals with a broader readership. I think the
description of Eq. 1 as a method to solving the "minimisation problem"
epitomises my concern. I could be in the minority, but "minimisation" is
not a term I encounter frequently in my reading. Therefore, I did not
initially understand why there was a "minimisation problem" that had to
be solved, much less understand how to solve it. I suggest the authors
provide a brief explanation about what SDID (or even DiD) achieves in
simpler terms (e.g., assess the effects of interventions by comparing
observed outcomes against predicted outcomes representing
non-intervention).*

*I liked the figures presented in this paper. In particular, I
appreciate the clean aesthetics of the plots presented here. However,
figures depicting outcomes of SDID in the main text and the
supplementary section can be difficult to decipher without additional
details about the application of SDID (or even of DID and SC). Without
prior knowledge, the captions and text do not provide sufficient
information about what the readers should look out for in the plots on
the left side of Figures 3, S3, and S5. For instance, the caption
mentions "arrows" indicating estimated effects, but the arrows are
difficult to see on the plot. Moreover, I recommend the authors include
additional information about the vertical lines representing ban
enforcement, as well as the significance of trend lines representing
post-ban averages and the SDID synthetic control, respectively. This
will make it easier to understand what the "estimates" in plots on the
right of Figures 3, S3, and S5 signify. Relatedly, the captions specify
that plots on the right of these figures represent "estimates concerning
trade volumes of each taxon". In my understanding, these should instead
refer to the estimated spillover effects of the ban? If my
interpretation is correct, the labelling of a 0 value for estimates
(i.e., vertical broken line) as "Trade (n)" is quite confusing. I
recommend the use of more precise descriptions in the plot and
captions.*

**Response**

We have revised the paragraphs in 4.2 Identification strategy. To avoid
ambiguity, we have used the equations with a brief explanation and with
reference to key literature ([@temp_id_043949734772749105];
[@n0wphb85evl]).

We have also updated the explanation of each figure. In particular, we
have deleted "Trade (n)" on the right column of all relevant figures and
used "Estimated spillover effects of the ban" to avoid the confusion.
Thanks for your suggestion.

**#1-6**

*I appreciate the concise nature of the paper. The authors did a good
job of providing key information butI believe that there is some room
for improvement. First, some context about the volume or relative
importance of online auctions as a platform for trading in animals could
help readers better understand the significance and applicability of
findings to the wider wildlife trade.*

*Second, the authors provide additional information about the relevant
policies in the methods section, but this information may be better
placed in earlier parts of the text to avert confusion about focal
species selection.*

*Third, I believe that the argumentation leading to the authors'
conceptualisation of spillover effects (Fig. 5) can be further
developed. The authors argue that spillover effects may be diluted when
more alternatives are available in the market, but they do not explain
what "alternatives" mean in the context of the wildlife (e.g., pet)
trade. The text (page 6) assumes that animals in the "freshwater taxon"
were potential alternatives to the golden venus chub, while animals
within the "salamander taxon" were potential alternatives to the Tokyo
salamander. These assumptions imply that potential buyers are unlikely
to consider taxonomically distant animals as alternatives to banned
species, yet I am unaware of supporting studies/papers. I recommend the
authors provide additional justification for this assumption, preferably
by citing relevant literature.*

**Response**

Thank you for your helpful suggestion. First, we have updated the
introduction to include some examples of online wildlife trade while
keeping the narrative and conciseness. The text now reads as follows

> *The recent rise in internet usage and the move of online trade can
> fuel wildlife trades through online e-commerce platforms and social
> media, increasing the risk of illegal and/or unsustainable trade in a
> wide variety of wildlife, for example, fish, reptiles, and mammals
> *^*7,\ 8,\ 9,\ 10*^*.* (Ln 21-24)

Second, we appreciate your suggestion; however, we have refrained from
providing details of (relevant) policies in the introduction to make the
narrative simple. Instead of that, we hope our modification of the
approach which was noted above (Response to your comment #1-1) has
resolved the challenge of species selection.

Third, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no empirical
studies working on alternatives in the context of pet trade; however, as
replied to your comment above (#1-2) some studies have discussed
substitutability in the context of traditional Chinese medicine (e.g.,
[@temp_id_847559567703378]; [@temp_id_9091081465521433]), which might
support that　wildlife with more similarities may be more likely to
become a substitute/alternative products. See our responses to your
comment #1-2 for further explanation.

**#1-7**

*Finally, there were several instances of imprecise or unclear writing.
I list these below, along with some suggestions for the authors'
consideration:*

1.  *Page 2: "It activated the underground market" suggests that
    underground markets only came into existence when CITES regulations
    came into effect. Perhaps consider revising to "These regulations
    coincided with a growing underground market".*

**Response**

We have carefully read the literature and confirmed the narrative. To
highlight the risk of unintended/negative consequences based on the
previous findings, we have remained this text here.

2.  *Page 2: "Even a few empirical studies have focused on introducing
    trade ban policies on banned species" is a confusing sentence.
    Consider revising to "A small number of empirical studies focus on
    quantifying the effects of trade bans, but the focus was on species
    that were the targets of the ban".*

**Response**

By considering your comments and to make the narrative more
straightforward, we have updated the paragraph. The text now reads:

> *However, most studies investigating the effect of trade ban policies
> have focused solely on banned species*^*12*^*, while the scarcity of
> comprehensive datasets on wildlife trade have resulted in limited
> policy evaluation studies*^*20*^*.* (Ln 34-36)

3.  *Page 7: Two sentences about exotic species trade and native species
    policies in developed countries were quite confusing to read. I
    recommend editing the sentences to "An increase in exotic species
    trade can increase overexploitation risk in source countries and
    lead to population declines unless appropriate management is
    implemented. Developing source countries may struggle to cope with
    the additional management needs as they often struggle to implement
    robust natural resource governance".*

**Response**

We have updated the sentence according to your suggestion. The text now
reads as follows:

> *An increase in exotic species trade can increase overexploitation
> risk in source countries and lead to population declines unless
> appropriate management is implemented*^*27*^*. Source countries, often
> developing countries, may face difficulties in meeting additional
> management needs because of the trade ban, as they often struggle to
> implement robust natural resource governance*^*4*^*.* (Ln 121-125)

*4) Page 9: "evidence regarding cross-country spillovers" seems to be a
very serious issue but no citations were provided to help readers learn
more about it. I recommend citing the relevant sources.*

**Response**

Sorry for this confusion. This sentence is supported by our findings; to
the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies working on
spillovers caused by wildlife trade ban regulations. We have replaced
evidence with findings to avoid the confusion.

*5) Page 9: "We suggest the development of a database comprising banned
and non-banned species" is a vague statement that may cover all known
species. I recommend the authors be more specific, perhaps by narrowing
the statement down to species known to be in the trade.*

**Response**

Thank you for this comment. To narrow it down, we have noted
traded/tradable species here (Ln 181). However, we believe (ideally) it
is worth monitoring all known species; therefore, applying modern
technologies such as machine learning would be essential (see Ln 166-178
in Discussion for example).

*In conclusion, I believe that this is a very promising study with an
important, policy-relevant message. However, the paper needs to be
revised for clarity. In particular, additional details about the study's
modelling approach will help improve reader comprehension and strengthen
the authors' argument about the significance of spillover effects from
trade bans.*

**Response**

We appreciate your helpful comments and positive evaluation. We have now
updated the details of modeling parts with the following key references.
See the 4.2 Identification strategy section for details.

## Evaluation 2 (anonymous reviewer), written report, and authors' response

*A generally well-written/reasonably well-argued paper addressing an
important implication of the wildlife trade - the indirect, and often
incidental effect of trade bans on the sale of species that may be
sought in markets by buyers as alternatives. The paper argues that bans
on the trade of species of conservation concern has spillover effects
into the trade of closely related species to meet market demand - the
premise is straightforward and often talked about but there have not
been that many studies to my knowledge that explicitly tests such as
hypothesis. Well done to the authors for putting this together.*

*The paper provides a timely case study of the nature and broader
consequences of trade bans in the context of the wildlife trade, and why
these consequences need to be more closely looked at after their
implementation. Data presentation and analytical framework based on the
application of SDID appears sound - and the authors have also gone on to
conduct sensitivity analyses.*

*I would recommend the publication of this paper with some minor
revisions, including tightening the language at many parts of the paper
for clarity and coherence, and also more caveats for the (public)
dataset used.*

*Principal claim - trade bans have spillover effects into the sale of
species not specifically targeted by the ban per se. The paper tests
this hypothesis and found what I would consider to be reasonable
evidence/support (although the volume of the species sold are relatively
small in my view). That said, I haven't seen many studies that have
investigate the causality of policy changes on trade of specific
species, so I find it interesting to see this being demonstrated here.*

*My confidence on the claims made - 70-75%%.*

*Analytical approach is sound and novel (this is the first time i have
seen the use of SDID to this sort of analyses), but i would recommend
more explicit recognition of the limitations that would come with such a
dataset (do you think there is leakage, sale of the banned species
through alternative markets). Blanket bans can drive several types of
outcomes in the trade of wildlife, and in many parts of the world where
governance is weak, there is bought to be leakage into the black market
(so what is reported formally may not fully capture the scale of
trade) - this would need to be made clever.*

*Ideally, it would be good to explore such patterns for a large suite of
species (and species that are trader in high volumes) but i appreciate
that this may not always be realistically possible.*

**Response**

We appreciate your positive opinion and helpful feedback. For our
responses to your comments, please see below.

### Specific comments:

*P2: More background to the online wildlife trade should be given in the
intro - for context setting. Suggest to provide examples of species and
species groups popular in the online trade. I find that the intro
currently reads very generically, and not particularly informative at
this stage.*

**Response**

We appreciate your comment. We have added some examples of online
wildlife trade while keeping our narratives. The text now reads:

> *The recent rise in internet usage and the move of online trade can
> fuel wildlife trades through online e-commerce platforms and social
> media, increasing the risk of illegal and/or unsustainable trade in a
> wide variety of wildlife, for example, fish, reptiles, and mammals
> *^*7,\ 8,\ 9,\ 10*^*.* (Ln 21-24)*.*

*P6: Interested to see how you derived these numbers for the alternative
taxa to be traded. Please provide citations. Also hard to define what is
'subsitutable' - in the eyes of buyers, although one reasonable position
is to provide lists of closely related species.*

**Response**

We apologize for this confusion. We have identified the spillover
impacts in each taxon which the banned species belongs to. We also note
that selecting three species might be arbitrary; however, the procedure
is objective and reproductive by three steps (see Methods for details).
In particular, since application of Google Trends and other social media
usage reveal human demand and interest in the context of wildlife trade
and others (e.g., Ladle et al. 2016 [@temp_id_43987407011669144]; Di
Minin et al. 2018 [@temp_id_673513791570447]; Padhi & Pati 2017
[@temp_id_29591687554986157]), we believe that the usage of Google
Trends in this study is more directly associated with spillover
mechanisms, and as noted in the Method section, if no candidate species
were available after considering the two criteria for each banned
species, the three phylogenetically closest species in the market were
selected using the phylogeny with reference to iNaturalist
(https://www.inaturalist.org/) and OneZoom (https://www.onezoom.org/).
Please see the Methods section for details. Furthermore, we have also
conducted several sensitivity analyses, for example, focusing on a
species in each taxon instead of three species (Table S4 in the SI).

*P8: Sounds more like you are providing policy and management
recommendations, than 'implications'. Lots of recommended steps provided
here - do make sure they are well substantiated- and backed by sources*

**Response**

We have carefully updated the paragraph with references according to the
latest findings. The text now reads as follows:

> *The findings have several important insights into consequences.
> First, demand caused by the trade ban can reach non-banned threatened
> species in countries where the ban is implemented. For example, a
> substitute for the giant water bugs Cybister chinensis is designated
> as vulnerable in the Japanese Red List and is extinct in five
> prefectures*^*26*^*. This effect potentially harms conservation of
> many legally tradable threatened species currently sold online by
> driving up demand for the alternatives, which can activate wild
> harvest. This concern is not limited to the country implementing trade
> bans. Spillover effects are not necessarily limited to native species;
> they are also applicable to exotic species, such as giant water bugs,
> from other countries. An increase in exotic species trade can increase
> overexploitation risk and lead to population decline unless
> appropriate management is implemented*^*27*^*. Trade regulations
> regarding native species in developed countries can burden developing
> countries with additional management needs as these countries often
> struggle to implement robust natural resource governance4. In addition
> to overexploitation risk, the imports and breeding of exotic species
> stimulated by the policy change raise concerns about the potential
> impacts of invasive species if exotic pet species are
> (un)intentionally released*^*27,\ 28*^*. Moreover, the more often
> exotic species in closely related taxa to the banned species are
> imported, the higher the risk of disease outbreaks that could affect
> the banned species29. Considering these concerns, we highlight the
> possibility of the existence of a feedback loop in which trade bans
> may accelerate biodiversity conservation threats. Trade bans can
> stimulate demand for non-banned species, triggering new regulations,
> and stimulate demand for other non-banned species, thus creating a
> self-perpetuating loop. Indeed, the commercial trade of Cybister
> chinensis, for which we detected the positive spillover effects from
> the big water bug in this study, has been prohibited since January
> 2023. As these processes can occur with other feedback challenges like
> Anthropogenic Allee Effect13, these multiple feedback loops may
> accelerate human-induced extinction of both banned and non-banned
> species*^*6,\ 30*^*.* (Ln 113-137)

*P8: Has there been any examples where a species has been substituted in
a formal/management-driven way?*

**Response**

The spillover species included water bugs imported from other countries
such as Brazil; however, to the best of our knowledge, there have been
no species in a formal/management-driven way.

*P8: How do you recommend that the monitoring be done, and how many taxa
can you effectively monitor, to determine the nature and direction of
these market shifts?*

**Response**

As we discussed (Ln 166-178), we believe that the latest computer
science technology can be utilized to identify traded species and cover
a variety of regulated and unregulated species in multiple taxa. With
the database, the latest statistical and/or prediction models can help
identify the determinants and predict future market shifts. For details,
please see the following studies as examples
([@temp_id_5800204050219071], [@temp_id_005305384225573695],
[@temp_id_4891478145115289]).

*P8: Can cut away the usual discussion about how biodiversity
conservation is afflicted by the lack of funds. Its well known, and does
not add a lot to your discussion.*

**Response**

We have carefully read the sentence and improved the narrative to avoid
the usual discussion although we have kept the text relevant to the lack
of funds because it is worth highlighting here that budget constraint
has limited monitoring effort. The text now reads:

> *Specifically, our findings insist that the monitoring should be
> extended to unregulated threatened species. However, as demonstrated
> by the case of Japan, where the conservation budget has increased only
> marginally while the number of protected species has been
> increasing*^*38*^*, it is essential to enhance monitoring efficiency
> and management capacity as conservation practices have faced
> substantial financial shortages*^*39*^*. There are several ways to
> improve monitoring efficiency and management capacity.* (Ln 168-178)

*P9: Do you have a good reasoning to want to pursue collaboration beyond
CITES? Could CITES provide the umbrella for these collaborations? I find
the last bits of the discussion to be rather general, and not much of a
value-add.*

**Response**

Thank you for your comments. This might be also relevant to the above
narrative. To develop the new framework to collaborate with countries
beyond CITES, we need further effort, which seems not feasible under the
current resource constraints. Since we acknowledge the current
framework, we have kept this narrative here. (Ln 179-185)

*P11: What steps did you take to manually check and confirm the species'
names?*

**Response**

Two or three people checked the same data (i.e., spreadsheet) to confirm
whether the extracted species name was correct. If they had any
conflicts concerning the names and/or there were any ambiguity, we
checked html files and/or description of the wildlife products.

### Minor comments

*P1: 'Regulations on the harvest and use of natural esosurces'*

**Response:** We have updated it by following your suggestion.

*P1: 'knee-jerk' probably captures what you mean more clearly.*

**Response:** We do not fully understand your comment here but we
believe the relevant words have been deleted and the updated paragraph
is now satisfactory.

*P1: 'heterogenous'*

**Response:** We have deleted it to follow the updated findings and
narratives.

*P1: What kind of modern technologies? Vague.*

**Response:** We have replaced it with machine learning technologies
according to the main in our manuscript.

*P2: Not clear what you mean by 'distribution' - of the species
afflicted? Please re-word*

**Response:** We have replaced it with species distributions.

*P6: I think 'show' is a better word.*

**Response:** We have replaced it with "show".

*P6: Side or incidental effects*

**Response:** We have replaced it with "side".

*P6: 'has important policy implications'*

**Response:** We have replaced it with "show".

*Figure 5: left panel vs right panel*

**Response:** We have deleted it.

*P7: be specific - harms conservation by driving up demand (for the
alternatives) - and increased wild harvest*

**Response:** Thanks for the suggestion; we have updated the sentence as
follows:\
*This effect potentially harms conservation of many legally tradable
threatened species currently sold online by driving up demand for the
alternatives, which can activate wild harvest.* (Ln 116-118)

*P7: accentuate threats to biodiversity - the trade bans can also
effectively undermine the conservation of species and species groups*

**Response:** We have replaced it with "accelerate threats to
biodiversity conservation".

*P8: accelerate declines of species*

**Response:** We have replaced it with "population decline".

*P10: demand*

**Response:** We have replaced it with "demand".

*P10: increased volumes of harvest for the trade*

**Response:** We have kept our words according to the policy in Japan.

*P10: What is the reasoning why these three species were chosen?*

**Response:** We do not provide whole reasonings; but, as noted in the
manuscript, the government picked them as representative of threatened
species in semi-natural ecosystems by considering their ecological
status and characteristics (Ln 210-213).

*P11: each taxon banned*

**Response:** We have updated the whole paragraph in 4.2 Identification
strategy. We hope the updated text is now satisfactory.
