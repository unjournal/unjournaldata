# Preamble

**Paper: **"The Environmental Effects of Economic Production: Evidence
from Ecological Observations"
([@https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3940045]).

**Authors: **Liang, Y., Rudik, I., & Zou, E.

This paper was selected as part of our [(NBER) direct evaluation
track](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/considering-projects/direct-evaluation-track "null").

*We organized two evaluations of this paper (1. Elias Cisneros, 2.
Anonymous). The authors also responded. To read the evaluations and the

# Evaluation manager's notes

**Why we chose this paper**

This NBER paper uses an extensive, longitudinal dataset comprising
ecological sampling information from thousands of locations across the
United States, and using a range of correlational and quasi-experimental
methods, it generates robust evidence that economic productivity has a
negative impact on biodiversity. Furthermore, by examining the
contribution of two potential mechanisms through which these impacts are
realised - namely air pollution and land-use change - the study provides
the start of an explicit diagnosis, and most importantly, a potential
way forward for mitigating the negative impacts of economic activity on
biodiversity. This is a very important discussion that must remain
central to global environmental and development policy discussions.

Evaluators were asked to follow the general guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators).
In addition to written evaluations (similar to journal peer review), we
ask evaluators to provide [quantitative
metrics](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#metrics-overall-assessment-categories)
on several aspects of each article. These are put together below.

## **How we chose the evaluators**

For this paper we organised two evaluations. Both evaluators are
environmental economics, with strong econometric skills. We chose them
explicitly so they could comment on the econometrics, as well as on the
overall research question.

Evaluators were asked to follow the general guidelines available
[here](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/key-issues-explanations-faq/policies-and-templates/guidelines-for-evaluators).
In addition to written evaluations (similar to journal peer review), we
ask evaluators to provide [quantitative
metrics](https://effective-giving-marketing.gitbook.io/unjournal-x-ea-and-global-priorities-research/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#metrics-overall-assessment-categories)
on several aspects of each article. These are put together below. For
this paper we did not give specific suggestions on 'which aspects to
evaluate'.

## **Summary of evaluations**

The evaluations are very positive overall, and both evaluators agree
that is highly relevant to Global Priorities. They also agree that the
authors address the limitations of the datasets rigorously, and that the
analyses are well-considered and robust. Some modest restructuring of
the paper is proposed to increase readability. In addition, the
evaluators propose some additional analyses that could potentially
bolster some of the findings - specifically, they propose that the
authors might examine the heterogeneity of the pollution
regulation-biodiversity association; to potentially also assess impacts
of productivity on bird taxa; and additional quasi-experimental analyses
are suggested that could further the analysis of both the mechanisms
(land-use policies, air pollution) explored in this study.
