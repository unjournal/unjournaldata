# Written report

## Overview

***Note from David Reinstein, Evaluation Manager:***[^3]

This evaluator considered the February 2022 (Stanford) working paper
version titled ["Designing Effective Celebrity Messaging Results From a
Nationwide Twitter Experiment Promoting Vaccination in
Indonesia"](https://web.stanford.edu/~arungc/ACMOP.pdf "null")

### Overall Summary

In this paper, the authors conducted a nationwide Twitter experiment in
Indonesia (pre-covid; this experiment took place in 2015-2016). The aim
of the experiment was to better understand which aspects of social media
campaigns are important for disseminating a message; in particular, the
role of celebrity endorsement (including celebrity authorship
specifically) and of referencing credible sources. I think this is a
highly important and relevant topic for global priorities research, that
addresses a gap in the literature (since there is significant
disagreement as to whether celebrity endorsements work or not.)

The paper's key findings were that (1) celebrity messages (regardless of
their social network position, i.e. the number of people who could see
the tweet) are more likely to be liked and retweeted, (2) most of this
effect comes from celebrity authorship, rather than merely passing on a
message, (3) citing external credible sources (perhaps surprisingly!)
decreases retweets, and (4) people who were exposed to more vaccination
messaging appeared to have more accurate immunisation knowledge, and
reported more vaccination among friends and neighbours.

In general, I think that the methods used were high-quality; although I
point to a few areas for additional clarification below. In particular,
I am unsure about whether there are potential confounds in measuring the
retweet/ liking behavior (for example, due to users being able to see
different comments and numbers of retweets across experimental
conditions, which might drive different patterns of retweeting/ liking).
Regarding the offline behavior, I am happy this is included since this
data is of key importance for practical application. However, I am
curious whether the people who were more likely to see the celebrity
tweets might be better-informed in general---it seems possible to me
that this might explain some of the results seen here, although this
could also reflect a misunderstanding on my part (i.e. I am not sure
that exposure to tweets was truly random; see below). I also note that
while the evidence is suggestive of a link between mass media campaigns
and increased vaccination rates, this data is not yet clear (since the
data here only speaks to the subjects' awareness of others' vaccination
status, which the authors themselves also point out). I think that
further research into how these campaigns into real-world behavior is
critically needed, since it is unclear whether retweets/likes are a
reasonable proxy for 'increase in vaccination rates' (which should be
the real measure of a campaign's success).

I point to some additional data that I would like to see. For this paper
specifically, I would like to see some more detail about the celebrities
who were included-- should we expect that the Twitter audiences are
pro-vaccination or against vaccination in general? I think we might see
very diverse effects according to the celebrities' Twitter audience
(i.e. if a Twitter celebrity with an anti-vaxxer following tweeted a
pro-vaccination message, I might expect fewer likes and retweets but
perhaps more vaccinations from people who would otherwise never have
gotten vaccinated). Understanding these effects seems to be a key step
prior to real-world implementation.

I think that the statistical methods used are appropriate, and I commend
the authors for pre-registering their study. However, I would love to
see the code and data used for this study openly available (e.g.
anonymised on DRYAD). I would also have liked to see more detail in the
pre-registration analysis plan.

Overall I think this is a good paper, examining a topic of key
importance. I think this study approaches a key question that is very
difficult to experimentally examine, and their methods (although not
perfect--- I think this would be impossible to do) are fairly rigorous.
I hope that further research is conducted in this area, so we have a
sufficient understanding as to put some of these principles into
practice- I do note some potential longterm implications of celebrity
endorsement (beyond the scope of this study) that we should attend to
prior to real-world application, and I emphasise that understanding the
psychological mechanisms underlying these effects may be key to ensuring
effective implementation/ understanding generalisability.

**Methods summary**

The experiment used two main interventions to examine online behavior.
In the first intervention, the authors tested (1) the effect of knowing
that the tweet originated from a celebrity, and (2) the effect of
knowing that the celebrity authored the tweet.

-   For (1), the authors took advantage of the fact that Twitter's
    timeline shows the identity of only two people within tweets; the
    originator who wrote the tweet, and the person who you follow who
    directly passed it to you (i.e. who retweeted it in your network).
    Here, the message would either originate directly from a celebrity
    (and be retweeted by the followers of the celebrity), or be authored
    by a Joe/ Jane (and be retweeted by a celebrity, before being
    retweeted by the celebrity's followers). The authors examined the
    behavior of the 'followers-of-followers' of the celebrities, because
    in the latter case these individuals would not be aware that the
    celebrity retweeted the message- they would only see the name of the
    regular user who wrote the message, and the person who they follow
    that directly passed it to them (the celebrity follower). This meant
    that it was possible for the authors to isolate the effect of
    knowing that the celebrity originated the message (versus a regular
    Twitter user), while holding the network position constant (since
    celebrities will generally have larger audiences than
    non-celebrities, but the celebrities have 'anonymously retweeted'
    the message from the perspective of the followers-of-followers, in
    the latter case). The authors found that tweets originating from a
    celebrity had a 72% increase in the retweet/ like rate, relative to
    those that originated from a regular Twitter user.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   One problem---which the authors spot--- is that F1's behavior
    (decision to retweet or not) may be endogenous- i.e. the specific
    F1s who decide to retweet may depend upon whether the celebrity
    authored the message or not. Although the equations that the authors
    used controlled for the log number of F1s who retweeted (and
    therefore the number of F2s who could potentially retweet it), it
    could be the case that especially influential F1s (i.e. the
    composition of F1s who retweet) could be endogenous and also affect
    F2's behavior.

    -   I think the authors' methods to account for this are reasonable.
        They used a subset of their Joes/ Janes (who were also F1s, i.e.
        direct followers of a celebrity), and had some of them randomly
        retweet the celebrity tweets/ retweets- creating exogenous F1s.
        They then analysed the experiment using the subsample with
        exogenous F1s. Given that the results were similar to that
        observed in the full experiment (point value estimates were
        actually a bit higher. I note that the p values are a bit lower,
        but I assume this is due to lower sample size), the authors
        concluded that this effect was not creating a bias in their
        results. Ideally, I would have liked to have seen more info
        about the authors' plan to deal with this within the pre-reg
        analysis plan.

-   I am less sure about the authors' response to the second potential
    confound; the fact that the retweets show the number of times that
    the original tweet has been liked and retweeted (which may vary by
    condition, since the treatment affects the retweet count). I am
    unsure of the extent to this effect (i.e. whether this created a
    difference in retweets across treatments that was considerably \>
    15; if so, I would remain unsure about whether this confound was
    contributing to the overall effect). Apologies if this is in the
    paper somewhere and I missed it.

-   An additional factor that I think could be somewhat endogenous---and
    does not appear to be mentioned in the paper---is the comments
    beneath the post. Based on my understanding of Twitter, I *think* F2
    would be able to see these under the tweets and retweets. I wonder
    if these comments (from F1s) are different (both in terms of content
    and volume) based upon whether the celebrity authored or retweeted
    the tweet, and if this affects F2's behavior differentially across
    condition. I would be really interested to see some analysis of
    this.

```
-   For (2), the authors then used the same experimental variation, but
    examined the celebrity followers; who had visibility into both the
    tweets that were directly authored by the celebrities, and the
    tweets that were written by a regular user but retweeted by a
    celebrity. The authors found that tweets that were authored by the
    celebrities were 200% more likely to be liked/ retweeted than those
    where the celebrity retweeted another Twitter user's tweet, implying
    that 79% of the celebrity endorsement effect comes from authorship
    specifically.

    -   I do not see any problems with this method; this is based on
        F1's behavior (rather than F2s), so there are not the same
        concerns about whether F1's behavior is endogenous.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In the second intervention, the authors tested the effect of
    including credible sources. To do this, they randomised whether a
    source was included in the tweet, and examined the behaviour of the
    celebrity followers. The authors found that citing a public health
    authority reduces the retweet and liking rate by 26.3%.

    -   I think these methods (looking at F1's behavior) are
        appropriate.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Importantly, the authors also measure offline behavior. As far as I
    am aware, this is the first real-world data examining behavior
    change as a result of a celebrity mass media campaign---I
    congratulate the authors for collecting this data, which I think is
    very important for real-world application. These offline effects
    were measured by randomising the celebrities into two phases. A
    survey of the celebrity followers was conducted between these
    phases, and the between-celebrity randomisation was used to estimate
    the impact of the Twitter campaign on offline beliefs and behaviors.
    (I.e. based on the number of celebrities that a user follows who
    were randomised to tweet before the phone survey, versus after).

    -   One potential problem I see (which could be a misunderstanding
        on my part) is that I think that 'Exposure to Tweets' is a
        function of both the number of celebrities that the individual
        follows at baseline (of the celebrities who were involved in the
        campaign), as well as whether the celebrities they follow happen
        to be randomised to tweet before or after the survey.
        Presumably, the individuals who follow more of the campaign's
        celebrities (and were therefore more likely to see the
        campaign\'s tweets before the phone survey) exhibit different
        characteristics than the average Twitter user (i.e. this method
        may present confounds).

        -   These individuals who follow a lot of the campaign's
            celebrities may follow more people in general, and perhaps
            be better-informed in general than their counterparts. These
            individuals might also spend more time on Twitter in general
            than the average user. Assuming that the celebrities who
            took part in this campaign are more health-conscious/
            accurate than the average celebrity (since they volunteered
            to take part in this campaign), these users might follow
            more accurate health sources in general than the average
            Twitter user, be more interested in health, or be people who
            are especially motivated to seek out immunisation
            information/ talk about health-related topics.

            -   I am therefore unsure if this explanation could
                contribute to the effect that the authors observe (that
                people with higher exposure to tweets were more likely
                to have heard of the Twitter hashtag, to have improved
                knowledge of immunisation facts, etc).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   I also note that although we have information about people's reports
    of others' vacciantion status, we can't be sure whether 'reports of
    increased vaccinations by friends/ neighbours/ etc' actually
    correspond to an increase in vaccination. It could also be the case
    that people are simply more likely to report their vaccination
    status to the people who have a higher exposure to the campaign's
    tweets (i.e. because they realise that person is more
    pro-vaccination than the average person) or the person is more
    likely to talk about/ remember other people's vaccination status.
    However, the authors do point towards this out, i.e. by saying 'does
    the campaign appear to change immunization behavior *as reported by
    our survey respondents*?'

    -   I would be curious if more survey questions were asked and not
        published (can't spot this information on the pre-registration
        or appendix.)

-   I also note that the subjects were recruited via ads (I assume that
    there wasn't another viable option). I do think that people who are
    likely to sign up for a study based on a Twitter advertisement are
    likely to be more heavily engaged with Twitter than the average
    user--perhaps these people are more likely to be responsive to
    informative tweets than the average (less engaged) Twitter user.

### Statistical methods summary

-   I think that the Poisson regression models used to estimate the
    effect of endorsement and authorship, and the logistic regression
    model used to understand the offline effects, are appropriate. I
    think that the statistical methods used in the paper are of
    high-quality, although I note that I am not especially familiar with
    some components of the authors' methods (e.g. double
    post-LASSO)---if other reviewers have more expertise here, I would
    defer to their views.

    -   One point of clarification (regarding the dummy variable used
        for the different types of messages included); am I correct that
        this only related to content (fact/ importance/ misconception
        correction?) If so, I wasn't sure why this had a dummy variable,
        since the message content factor was already randomised. This
        may be a misunderstanding on my part.

    -   I commend the authors for pre-registering their study on the AEA
        RCT registry. However, the analysis plan
        ([here](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/757)) is
        blank. I think this is an oversight since it left me unable to
        assess whether there were deviations from the original analysis
        plan (e.g. if lots more survey questions were asked and results
        not reported).

    -   The data and code used to analyse this study don't appear to be
        publicly available. If possible, I think that having data (e.g.
        anonymised and placed on DRYAD) and code available would be of
        significant benefit.

### Relevance to global priorities

-   I think the topic is of high importance, and is very relevant to
    global priorities (although I think that more research is needed
    until this paper can be action-guiding in practice; see below.)

    -   Understanding the role of celebrity endorsement in driving up
        immunisation is a gap in the literature, where there is
        significant disagreement. If celebrity endorsement does work to
        drive up vaccination rates, this could be a key method used to
        improve vaccination rates in people who might not have gotten
        vaccinated otherwise. Given the reach of social media, these
        interventions have the potential to be hugely impactful if they
        do have an effect upon their audience.

-   I would love to see more information about the celebrities who
    volunteered for this campaign;

    -   A key question I have for this study regards the celebrities
        (and their followers) who volunteered to be a part of this
        campaign. Thinking about the US, vaccination hesitancy became
        split along political lines- I would expect that celebrities
        with lots of democratic-leaning followers would get a lot of
        retweets/likes of a pro-vaccination tweet, but probably fewer
        'counterfactual' vaccinated people as a result. I.e. I would
        expect that the people who liked these tweets were always pretty
        likely to get vaccinated, regardless of the tweets from that
        celebrity. Are there likely to be similar effects going on
        within the Indonesian data? I am not sure if any of the
        campaign's celebrities had Twitter audiences who were especially
        likely to be against vaccination, or who were likely to be
        especially pro-vaccination. I'd love to see some microdata about
        how people from different audiences (based on characteristics of
        the celebrity's typical Twitter following) respond to these
        tweets; I suspect some celebrities have a far higher impact (in
        terms of driving up vaccination rate) than others.

-   Understanding 'why this works';

    -   As a general point (outside the scope of this paper), I think
        that understanding *why* celebrity endorsements work (from a
        psychological perspective) will be key to ensuring their best
        use, and to understanding the generalisability of the findings
        from this paper. For example, is it that some people trust
        celebrities more than official healthcare organisations? If so,
        it might be best to target celebrities that are highly trusted
        in vaccine-hesitant communities. On the other hand, perhaps
        people want to be similar to high-prestige celebrities? If so,
        it might be best to target celebrities that people in
        vaccine-hesitant communities admire or want to be like. Without
        understanding these mechanisms, policy-makers are liable to make
        implementation errors that reduce effectiveness. I think that
        this mechanistic understanding is key to understanding whether
        these results will generalise to other populations.

        -   Similarly, to what degree should we expect social media
            behavior to follow-through to real-world behavior? Is it the
            case that people retweet certain celebrities to generate a
            particular image on social media, or because they are more
            altruistically motivated to pass on accurate information?
            Understanding these factors may help researchers to design
            their campaigns appropriately (i.e. to drive up vaccination
            rates- note that the amount of retweeting/liking may be an
            inaccurate proxy of a media campaign's success).

    Regarding the finding that citation of credible sources decreases
    retweets;

    -   I have a lot of uncertainty here, and highlight the need for
        more research. I suspect this is an area where (as above)
        understanding 'what is the mechanism underlying this effect' may
        be important.

        -   Is it that including these citations makes a tweet less
            readable and look more boring? Is it that people on social
            media mistrust medical organisations in general? Is it that
            including these citations makes it clearer that the tweet is
            not in the celebrities 'own words' (so it looks less
            personal)? The best solution is dependent on which factor is
            driving this effect.

            I am also unclear if 'number of retweets' is a good proxy
            here for the result that a policy maker would be most
            interested in- 'number of additional vaccinations'. It
            doesn't seem impossible to me that linking to a credible
            source might generate fewer retweets (e.g. if it looks more
            academic/ boring) but result in more vaccinations (e.g. it
            might be more boring, but it's also more trustworthy- and
            that's the factor that matters more for real-world
            behavior).

        -   Finally, there might be longterm effects to encouraging
            celebrities to cite (or not cite) credible medical sources.
            Perhaps encouraging celebrities to cite these sources
            increases trust in these organisations in the long run, even
            if it results in fewer retweets (I have no idea, but just to
            highlight that there may be longterm effects here beyond the
            number of retweets).

    Although this is outside the scope of this paper, I think it is
    worth considering whether there are potential long-term deleterious
    effects of healthcare organisations partnering with celebrities.

    -   I think a cost-benefit analysis might well still say that the
        effect is likely to be very beneficial overall. But some risks
        include if the celebrity is then photographed going against the
        advice they gave (e.g. not wearing a mask, breaking social
        isolation rules etc)- perhaps this could result in a loss of
        trust against the healthcare organisation in general.

        I am not sure whether (over a long-term timeframe) this kind of
        partnership might encourage people to rely on celebrities for
        healthcare information, rather than going to credible sources-
        which could obviously have negative effects.

        -   On the other hand, perhaps people who update on healthcare
            information from celebrities would never rely upon the
            credible sources anyway.
