**Overall assessment: **We asked evaluators to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to all serious research in the
same area that you have encountered in the last three years." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to knowledge production, and importance to practice."

**Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): **"On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in? (See
ranking tiers discussed
[here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers "null"))"

requested ratings.*

# Written report

Overall, I find the project to be positive, and have provided detailed
comments and suggestions below.

1.  **Advancing knowledge and practice**

The project attempts to estimate the individual returns to temporary
migration of Indian construction workers to the UAE. This is a heavily
debated topic with considerable welfare implications for both the source
and destination countries, for which there is a significant gap in the
literature. The authors do a good job of arguing the importance,
neglectedness and tractability of their research question.

2.  **Justification, reasonableness, validity, and robustness of
    methods**

The methods are clearly justified and explained. The methods and
underlying assumptions are reasonable and commonplace for an
experimental set-up. The authors are open about potential sources of
bias and the viability of the assumptions, and they discuss the
representativeness of their sample, the attrition problem that comes
with follow-up surveys, etc; and they address for these issues as they
can.

However, there is a limitations in the methodology. When individuals
could not be reached for follow-up surveys, their friends and family
members were interviewed about the individual's whereabouts and earnings
instead (pp. 13 -- 14). These observations are at an increased risk of
measurement error than those where individuals themselves answered the
survey. However, the authors do not discuss the possibility of
measurement error here, or how to address it for the regressions where
these observations are included.

3.  **Logic and communication**

Most concepts are clearly defined, and the reasoning is transparent. The
data, analysis, tables and figures are relevant. The authors'
conclusions are consistent with the evidence.

However, two things are unclear. First, the terms of the contract
between the labour broker and the job seeker (Background section, pp. 8
-- 9) were unclear. Specifically, do job seekers have to pay the
contingent agent fee if they are offered a job but decide not to take
it? If not, this could be a reason why some individuals in the treatment
group choose to remain in India, as the new increased wage they would
get in the UAE is not enough to make it worthwhile to pay the contingent
agent fee. In this case, the reasons for individuals choosing to remain
in India are not necessarily non-pecuniary as argued by the authors. If
data is available, it would be interesting to check for heterogeneity in
the effects of the UAE job offer by the level of contingent agent fee,
particularly as there is considerable variation in the fee amount
(depicted in Table 1, pp. 8).

Second, in follow-up surveys individuals are recorded as either: (i)
having migrated to the UAE, (ii) having stayed in their home district in
India, or (iii) having moved to a new district in India (discussion in
pp. 15-16, follow-up survey questions in Table A.5 pp 56-57). Here, a
fourth option is that individuals migrate to foreign countries other
than the UAE. It is unclear whether this option is assumed away, or
whether it is simply a feature of the sample that none of the
individuals migrated to another country.

4.  **Open, communicative, replicable science**

The methods are explained sufficiently, and the authors are open about
potential limitations, discussing them at length. The authors make a
variety of summary statistics and tables available. The original data is
not provided, but this is commonplace in experimental set-ups.

5.  **Other comments**

Suggestion: when discussing the effect of the UAE job offer on
individuals' social networks, the authors do not control for the
individual belonging to a minority or majority caste or religious group
within their region. This data is straight-forward to get from the IDHS
(which the authors use elsewhere in the paper). Adding this variable
could show some interesting patterns regarding belonging to a "minority"
or "majority" group at home and attitudes towards new friend groups once
one becomes a migrant and therefore the minority.
