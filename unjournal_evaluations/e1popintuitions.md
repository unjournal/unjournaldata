# Abstract 

Highly policy relevant, original research with clear hypothesis tests
and valid statistical analyses.\
\
Biases and framing effects are mitigated but remain difficult to avoid
in such surveys. Some results (e.g. the negative utilitarian judgments
and a lack of asymmetry) seem to be contradictory. One possible
explanation for an apparent contradictory result is not addressed.

# Summary Measures

We asked evaluators to give some overall assessments, in addition to
ratings across a range of criteria. *See the *[*evaluation summary
"metrics"*](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumpopintuitions#metrics "null")*
for a more detailed breakdown of this. See these ratings in the context
of all Unjournal ratings, with some analysis, in our *[*data
presentation

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

People do not hold the neutrality and procreation asymmetry intuitions.
They believe that adding a happy person is good and is as good as adding
an equally intense unhappy person is bad. This 'non-neutral symmetry'
result is observed in studies 2a and 2b of the paper. If people expect
future populations have net positive welfare levels (that are at least
as high as past and present generations), the symmetry view entails that
policymakers should prioritize existential risk reduction above
suffering reduction.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^5] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

I have weak confidence in the result: I expect the neutrality and
(a)symmetry views strongly depend on the context (e.g. on the choice
set: the possible populations that one could choose). In some contexts,
such as situations where one could avoid a repugnant conclusion, people
may hold the asymmetry view more strongly (especially after reflection).
In future research, one could investigate such possible context or
choice-set dependence.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^6] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

A survey that measures people's population ethical judgments in
choice-set dependent contexts and under more reflection. E.g. do people
still prefer population A over population B when population C becomes an
option and when they learn about e.g. repugnant or sadistic conclusions
that could arise in such contexts or choice sets?

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

I consider it as (weak) evidence to prioritize existential risk
reduction over suffering reduction.

# Written report

The paper discusses nine surveys that were conducted to measure people's
moral intuitions about three population ethical issues: does suffering
(the existence of people with negative welfare) outweigh happiness (the
existence of people with positive welfare), does the average welfare of
a population outweigh the total welfare, and does the welfare of
existing people outweigh the welfare of possible people who could be
brought into existence?

The results show that when making axiological-utilitarian judgments
(i.e. evaluating the state of a population based merely on the welfare
outcomes and the size of the population), people may be slightly
negative utilitarian (depending on the intensity of the happiness
levels, at least 1.5 to 3 happy humans should exist for each equally
intense unhappy human, in order for the state to be positive), their
intuitions may be a little bit more average than total utilitarian (the
average welfare of a population often matters slightly more than the
total welfare, especially when judged intuitively and when differences
in average welfare between different states are large), they may be more
variable value utilitarian for positive welfare levels (at small
populations with positive welfare, increasing total welfare by adding an
averagely happy person is more important than at larger happy
populations), they intrinsically value the size of a population (adding
a neutral life to a neutral population is good when the population is
small and neutral when the population is large), and they do not adhere
to the strong person-affecting view (the welfare of potential people
that could exist counts to some nonzero degree) nor the procreation
asymmetry (adding a happy person is considered as good as adding an
equally intense unhappy person is bad).

To my knowledge, this paper is the first one to study people's
population ethical views. This is not only of academic interest, but is
also highly policy relevant, both on a micro-level, concerning people's
reproductive choices, but especially on a macro-level, concerning
humanity's future and survival. To what degree people value future
people's existence and welfare has important implications for
existential risk mitigation. Should we prioritize decreasing the
probability of human extinction, or rather improving the welfare of
current and future generations?

The study not only has great importance but also great validity. The
authors put a lot of effort in avoiding respondent's biases (while they
sufficiently acknowledge that important biases and framing effects may
still be present and hard to avoid). They conducted several surveys to
study the robustness of their results and interpretations. For example,
the fact that people's inter-individual and intra-individual comparisons
strongly agree (in both studies 1a and 1c, see figures 1and 3), is a
strong indication that respondents filled in the surveys thoughtfully.
The preregistered hypothesis tests were very clear and straightforward,
and hence do not allow much room for data dredging or p-hacking.

## Major suggestions[^7]

I have only one relevant point of critique, which is my major suggestion
for improvement. Above, I wrote: "people *may be* slightly negative
utilitarians." I think based on studies 1a to 1c, the authors are too
quick to draw the conclusion that the respondents weigh suffering
stronger than happiness.

The framing of the survey question may create a bias. The question
reads: "*Given this information, what percentage of happy and unhappy
people would there have to be for you to think that this world is
overall positive rather than negative (i.e., so that it would be better
for the world to exist rather than not exist)?"* However, I doubt
whether the indicated percentage (around 75%) is the reverse of the
percentage of the following negatively framed question: "*what
percentage of unhappy people would there have to be for you to think
that this world is overall negative rather than positive (i.e., so that
it would be worse for the world to exist rather than not exist)?"* I
wonder whether the average percentage of this last question would be
25%, in line with the first question.

When people respond that 75% of the population should be happy in order
for the state to be positive, they could mean for example: "At 50% happy
people, more or less, the world would be neutral. But at least 75% of
the population should be happy in order for me *to be sufficiently
confident* that the world is *strictly* positive overall." It could also
be that when the percentage of happy people is between 25% and 75%,
respondents believe that the world is 'on par with', 'incommensurate
with' or 'undistinguished from' a neutral state. See Qizilbash
(2007)[@nuod8q91jzr] and especially Gustafsson (2020)[@nm8ps9rc2o5]. If
that is the case, only when the percentage is above 75% or below 25%,
the world is clearly positive or negative respectively. Therefore, in
this case with Gustafsson's undistinguishedness or incomparability,
there can still be a symmetry and hence no negative utilitarian
asymmetric weighing of happiness and suffering.

The present survey results are consistent with such a symmetric weighing
of positive and negative welfare. The authors do not discuss this
possibility in their paper (though they very briefly touch on this issue
in section 16.5 "Limitations"). In a future survey, researchers could
use both positive and negative framings of the questions that were used
in surveys 1a, 1b and 1c, to test this symmetry. If the apparent
asymmetry of the results in surveys 1a, 1b and 1c is due to a framing
effect, the apparent contradiction with the observed symmetry in survey
questions 2a and 2b could be resolved.

## Further small suggestions

1.  Concerning averagism versus totalism, I'm curious to what degree the
    distribution is bimodal: perhaps a fraction of the population is
    purely averagist and the other part is purely totalist? Or perhaps
    the distribution is unimodal and most people prefer a social welfare
    function that is a mixture of average and total welfare? Figure 8
    does not show the distribution. It would be nice to include a figure
    with violin plots, as in figure 7.\

2.  I would recommend to also report the medians next to the means,
    because the distributions are often skewed. Knowing the medians may
    be relevant from a policy perspective, considering the median voter
    theorem.
