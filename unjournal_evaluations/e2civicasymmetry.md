# Abstract 

This paper reports an RCT of a taxpayer education campaign in Togo,
showing increased tax knowledge, a shift in the distribution of tax
payments, and higher reported revenues. The reviewer finds the study
valuable in its focus on small firms and the large tax knowledge
effects. It offers suggestions concerning measurement bias due to
enumerator involvement in the intervention, accountability measures, and
interpretation of payment effects.

# Written report

This paper studies a randomized taxpayer education campaign within a
sample of 383 small firms in Lomé, Togo. The treatment includes modules
on tax code information as well as information about the types of public
goods that tax revenues should be spent on. They find that the campaign
increases tax knowledge substantially. They also find evidence that the
campaign decreases tax payments on the extensive margin but increases
the average amount paid. They also find increases in reported orders and
revenues. They rationalize these findings in a simple model in which
greater bargaining power among firms leads to fewer (slightly larger)
firms paying taxes but those payers actually paying more.

This is an interesting paper. It makes a nice contribution to the
literature by (a) studying taxpayer education, and providing to my
knowledge the first RCT on this topic, and (b) studying small firms,
which are difficult to study in the field but of great interest to tax
authorities in developing countries. The large increase in taxpayer
knowledge is striking: there are clearly massive information frictions
facing small firms in this setting. The effects on tax payments are
interesting, though I have some questions about their interpretation
(see below). I also found it very interesting that providing this
information (likely the section about public goods) leads firms to
update negatively about the performance of the government.

I have a few comments on the current version.

### \[Same enumerators, causal identification\][^4] 

First, as I understand it, the intervention was delivered by the same
enumerators who conducted the baseline and endline surveys. This is a
bit concerning because it introduces the possibility of endline
reporting varying because respondents have greater knowledge of and
trust in the enumeration team. While this does not concern validated
measures like tax payment---which relies on showing a receipt---it does
make me a bit more wary of interpreting reports of economic activity. I
also think it leads to an exclusion restriction violation for the 2SLS
strategy, which currently assumes the treatment can only operate through
the channel of improving knowledge. Can the authors test this in some
way in the data, i.e., by looking at proxies for familiarity with or
trust in the enumerator? This leads me to think the authors might
consider dropping the 2SLS and replacing it with correlational analysis
between knowledge and tax payments.

### \["Accountability" interpretation\]

** **Second, I wonder if it is wise to emphasize the fiscal contract and
accountability as much here given that the measure of accountability is,
in my mind, quite indirect and a bit difficult to interpret as
accountability. Here is the relevant section: "The second indicator is
whether the firm specifies an opinion about whether taxes are being put
to good use. Firms can answer "Yes", "No" or "I don't know." The
variable then indicates the firms that do not answer "I don't know"
since firms with an opinion are more likely to view taxation as a fiscal
contract (Accountability)." Firm respondents could answer "I don't know"
for many reasons. Similarly, is a "yes" here really consistent with
firms demanding accountability? I was not sure. I am assuming that the
level of public goods provided remains low. This intuition is supported
by Table 10, which shows a negative effect of the treatment on a
question about government performance. Is this the same question? It
seems perhaps closer to accountability, but I did not see Table 10
referred to in the text. Yet, I found this table quite interesting.[^5]

It appears that informing taxpayers what public goods should come from
their taxes leads them to lower their views of government. That seems
plausible and quite interesting and relevant for the design of future
taxpayer education campaigns. In particular, it suggests that designers
of information campaigns must think carefully about taxpayers'
potentially high expectations about public goods. On this, see van den
Boogaard et al "Enabling Tax Bargaining: Supporting More Meaningful Tax
Transparency and Taxpayer Engagement in Ghana and Sierra Leone" 2025. I
would bring Table 10 more closely into the analysis.

### \[Tax payment results: more detail warranted\]

Third, on the tax payment results, I would have appreciated further
details in the analysis. In particular, I had several questions while
reading this section:

a\)     These firms are only responsible for paying TPU if I understood
well. It seems the treatment causes firms to realize the tax they pay is
the TPU. But I was not clear if we can interpret this reduction in
payment as (smaller) firms realizing that they are exempt from other
non-TPU taxes and stopping paying those? That seems the most natural
interpretation, and it would help the manuscript to make this a bit
clearer.

b\)    Alternatively, the authors find that "treated firms are 19
percentage points more likely to report that the hypothetical firm would
have declared that they had not earned any revenue". This is another
hypothesis: smaller firms learn that they can self-declare a zero. This
could be a reason for negative effects. Why is there not a table looking
at the effect of treatment when self-declaring a zero?

c\)     The receipt-based measure of tax compliance is nice, however it
would help to discuss (i) whether this only includes TPU receipts, (ii)
how receipts were validated -- do they have photographs or are they
relying on enumerator perceptions?

### \[Interpretation of Economic Activity Results\] 

Fourth, for the economic activity results, is it possible that by better
understanding their requirements for paying TPU, firms simply pay more
attention to their orders and revenue, i.e. by improving their
book-keeping? That seems like a plausible explanation of the results,
and I was wondering if the authors could test it with the survey data.

### \[Limited treatment information\]

Fifth, treatment information: I found the information provided about the
content of the taxpayer information intervention to be limited. All we
get in Figure 1 concerns a tax on advertising that does not come up much
in the manuscript (which seems to focus more on TPU). It would be
helpful to provide a more complete summary (ideally translated) of the
information contained in the intervention.

### \[Statistical power\]

Sixth, power: an obvious concern is the small sample size, particularly
when the authors cut the same to look at heterogeneity. However, I
commend the authors for being transparent about their power in the
manuscript. It might be nice to do the same thing for the sample splits
considered in the heterogeneity analysis (Figures 7-8).

### \[Were tax collectors aware of the intervention?\]

Seventh, I like the theoretical framework. The intuition it provides
seems well suited for the context. One small question in terms of how
Proposition 1 maps to the data, however, is whether tax collectors were
sufficiently aware of the intervention to change their audit targeting
strategies? It seems the variation in firm size within the sample is
small and would be hard for tax inspectors to observe and adjust their
behavior accordingly?

### \[Test for likelihood of a visit\]

Eighth, "While the treatment itself could affect the likelihood of a
visit, the patterns that we observe are still instructive." Can't they
test whether the treatment affected the likelihood of a visit directly?
