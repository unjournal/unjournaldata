# Abstract 

This paper reports an experiment on deontological (ends versus means)
preferences using incentivized experiments, including a "trolley
problem" where subjects can choose to save real lives.
Non-consequentialist preferences are common, but are situation-specific
and not linked to conventional social preferences such as altruism. The
experiment is well-executed, and results are credible and interesting.
Questions remain whether economic lab experiments are the best tool to
characterize subjects' ethical views.

# Claim identification and assessment

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^4] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

About 25% of people make deontological decisions in a "trolley problem"
with real consequences, i.e. they do not intervene to stop the saving of
one statistical life (via money donations to a charity), even though
doing so would enable the saving of three statistical lives elsewhere.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^5] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

In the exact same experimental setup, but across a broader population
e.g. a random sample of Europeans, I'd have a 80% credible interval of
10-40% deontologists. Across a more broader set of real-life means vs.
end dilemmas with serious consequences, that would be wider, but I'd
give an 80% probability that any given dilemma would have at least 5% of
deontologists.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^6] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

A similar experiment with a random population sample could estimate this
parameter in a more interesting population. Ultimately, interaction with
political and ethical philosophers might be more important for
determining how useful the above number is.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^7] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

If you think that public policy should be informed by the electorate's
moral preferences, then this result could be quite important for funding
priorities. For example, it might go against using foreign aid as a tool
for foreign policy, even when that would maximize global welfare.
However, not all philosophers would agree (a) that it should be so
informed or (b) that it should be informed in this particular way.

# Written report

*This paper reports an experiment on deontological (ends versus means)
preferences using incentivized experiments, including a "trolley
problem" where subjects can choose to save real lives.
Non-consequentialist preferences are common, but are situation-specific
and not linked to conventional social preferences such as altruism. The
experiment is well-executed, and results are credible and interesting.
Questions remain whether economic lab experiments are the best tool to
characterize subjects' ethical views.*

This paper reports a lab experiment investigating deontological
reasoning among humans. While sometimes, decision-makers are
consequentialist -- choosing actions by comparing their consequences for
themselves or others -- at other times, they may reason deontologically,
treating certain actions as "beyond the pale" irrespective of their
consequences. For example, they might refuse to murder someone if even
if doing so will save many lives. Or they might refuse to tell a lie
even if it will have a large social benefit. The experiment confronts
subjects with several of these "ends versus means" decisions, in an
incentivized format, i.e. where consequences are real not imaginary.
This includes a real-decision version of the famous "trolley problem",
where people can choose to kill one person in order to save five lives.
This is implemented using donations to a charity in different parts of
India, where individuals can intervene in an existing donation, "not
saving" one statistical life (on average!) by "saving" three statistical
lives in a different Indian state.

The authors report three key results: (1) many people indeed choose
deontologically, about 20-45% across decisions; (2) deontological
reasoning, including choice in the "trolley problem", is not consistent
across subjects; (3) deontological choices also do not correlate with
standard "social preferences", which capture how individuals weigh their
own and others' welfare. They show this by looking at correlations
between different decisions.

On its own terms I have no beef with this paper; I think it broadly
shows what it claims, *modulo* one issue below. The experiment is
well-executed and incentives were large. In particular, choices in the
real-world version of the trolley problem could statistically save one
or more human lives. Statistics are simple and quite convincing, and the
authors have done several robustness checks.

### \[Conceptual critique\][^8]

That said, I'm not sure it is quite thinking about its topic in the
right way.

What does it mean to say people reason deontologically or
consequentially? Economists have a natural answer in terms of
preferences. That is, people have a moral theory ready-made in their
head; confronted by a choice situation, they apply it. Just as their
choice of consumer goods might reflect their inner preference relation,
so their choice of ends versus means might reflect their inner moral
theory.

Haidt (2001)[@np212ma8qy1] suggests a different view: people's moral
choices reflect a set of innate moral intuitions. They don't have a
coherent theory, indeed, they make up their theory to suit their
intuitions, and if it is challenged, they react like Groucho Marx: "if
you don't like my principles... well, I have others!" Relevant variation
between individuals is in the strength of the different underlying
intuitions ("foundations" in the Haidt quiz, which was given to
subjects). So Haidt might not be surprised by the fact that the authors
don't find much coherence: the relatively neutral framing of economic
experiments may simply not engage those intuitions much.

Habermas (1985)[@n3ya3l09w0r], a fan of the earlier moral psychologist
Kohlberg (1977)[@npuydaslv6v], might have a more optimistic view. Again,
people's moral beliefs aren't stored as a fully-worked out theory, but
they arrive at it through communication with others. There might still
be differences in people's underlying approach to moral questions; these
differences are not necessarily "there for the taking" in choice
experiments, but need to be brought out.

The authors might respond that they simply set out to see how people's
actual consequential behaviour reflects different moral theories, rather
than the psychological subtleties above. Fair enough, but note that
then, if they don't find consistency between moral decisions, they may
be hunting for consistency in the wrong places.

In short, it's possible that there are consistent differences between
people's moral views, but that economic experiments are not good at
finding it.

### \[Relevance\]

In terms of relevance, the experiment aims to gauge the prevalence of
different moral intuitions in the population. Indirectly, this is
important if you think democratic policy ought to respect the
electorate's moral preferences. As the authors put it "standard social
welfare functions may be misleading guides to normative decisions." The
perspectives above, though, also suggest other ways of thinking about
how people's normative preferences *should* be reflected in policy.

Despite these comments, I still think this is an interesting and
valuable paper for economists and philosophers. In particular, it is
important news that many people behave deontologically in a
real-incentive version of the trolley problem. That allays one critique
of the standard trolley problem, that it is just an imaginary vignette.

## Reliability

The authors interpret their results as showing that deontological
behaviour is context-specific: bad news for policy-makers hoping to
reason about people's moral intuitions from general principles. A still
more gloomy interpretation would be that moral behaviour is pure noise.
That is, not only may choices in *different* EVM \[ends versus means\]
experiments not correlate within the same person, repeated choices in
the *same* experiment might not correlate either. It would be nice to
know the test-retest reliability of the EVM paradigms.

## Confusion

Another possibility is that individual choices don't really reflect
people's moral behaviour. This might be true, for example, if subjects
find the paradigms "weird" and don't really understand them.

In particular, I'm uncertain about the "bribe" game. Here, subjects were
confronted with another person who had chosen to trigger a €20 donation
to charity (rather than €2 for themselves) *only* if the subject chose
to send them €2 (rather than send €15 to the charity). This wasn't
described as a bribe and it's not totally clear that subjects would see
it that way. It's less moral to give someone €2 than to give a charity
€15, but is it a rule violation like bribing a public official? Might
decisions here be motivated by dislike of the greedy other?

Similarly, the "statement choice" involved subjects pressing a button
with an ethically unattractive statement written on it, but no
consequences except for a donation to charity. Does doing so really
violate a deontological rule? This dilemma seems more likely to engage
moral emotions (à la Haidt 2001)[@nmjpkezocjh] than true moral
reasoning.

The authors run an "aligned" version of these experiments where the
deontological and utility-maximizing choices are the same, and observe
that almost everyone chooses the best option here. This shows that
subjects understood the working of the experiment, and pure confusion of
*that* kind wasn't driving the results. But subjects may still have
found the moral dilemmas of the original experiments confusing. Put
another way: they may not be confused about *how the experiment worked*,
but they may still find it hard to apply their moral frameworks when
deciding *what is the right thing to do*.

Of course this is a hard critique to avoid or rule out. Understanding is
not all-or-nothing. Paradigms can be easier or harder to understand, and
they may elicit deeper or shallower moral engagement from more or fewer
subjects. The experimental choices were carefully designed and morally
consequential, especially in the trolley problem. I doubt if any single
experiment could definitively prove a result of "no deontological
consistency": if it's confirmed, it will have to come from a range of
different evidence.

## Ethics

There is an ethical issue. Psychological experiments often use
deception. Experimental economists eschew this, believing that they risk
credibility in future experiments. The authors could have chosen to
implement efficient decisions in the real-life trolley problem, i.e.
always saving the most lives, rather than implementing the subjects'
possibly inefficient decisions. This would have made the experiment
deceptive, which for sure raises ethical and methodological issues. But
it would also have saved about 593 (experimental N) x 10% (of decisions
chosen for implementation) x 25% (of deontological choosers) x 2 (3
lives saved versus 1) = 29 lives. Surely this should outweigh any harm
from deception. What was the moral reasoning here?

## Other points

#### \[Lack of real preregistration\][^9] 

Results are "registered" though only in the broad sense of the research
question. This isn't real preregistration. At the same time, the authors
are reporting many null results, and it does not seem like they are
digging for significance: indeed, the null results are presented as
interesting.

#### \[External validity and demographics\] 

External validity, always a question for lab experiments, looms large
here, because the paper makes claims about the population distribution
of moral preferences. I think as a first cut, using lab subjects (WEIRD
students, Henrich et al. 2010)[@nxwwvt3tw6h] is reasonable, especially
since there seems to be little variation by demographics. But it would
be nice to address this explicitly.

#### \[Address concerns of moral philosophers\] 

The presentation is quite focused on economics, in terms of finding the
distribution of preferences in the population. A natural target audience
for this paper would be moral philosophers (the real world trolley
result is probably the big takeaway here). They might have different
interests and concerns, relating to the huge literature on the trolley
problem. Addressing those might be helpful.

#### \[Presentation to subjects\] 

That subjects were also faced with the (hypothetical, unrealistic)
"trolley problem" as well as the (hypothetical or not) Saving A Life
paradigm is buried mid-paragraph, so when I came to Figure 4 I found it
confusing.

#### \[Flow diagrams\]

The flow diagrams in Figure 6 were not very intuitive to me personally.
I think simple pairs of bars would work better (e.g. % who chose to
bribe among trolley deontologists and trolley utilitarians).

#### \[Figure 7 --- U-shaped?\] 

The authors argue Figure 7 shows evidence against consistency in the EVM
games, because it shows a hump-shaped distribution of numbers of
deontological choices. So, do we see a U-shaped pattern for the SVO
games?

#### \[Statistical test\] 

Is there a formal statistical test for consistency that could be applied
to the PCA analysis in Figure 8?

#### \[Repetition\] 

The data in Table 3 is repeated in Table 4. The authors could probably
unify these.
