[^1]: See main review

[^2]: The paper itself makes an important argument about resilient
    foods, but I don't know if the additional element of AGI risk adds
    much to Denkenberger & Pearce (2016)

[^3]: Very major limitations around the survey method, and
    implementation of certain parts of the parameter sensitivity
    analysis. However many elements of a high standard

[^4]: Many components to rate, composite uncertainty in my rating :\|
    many choices left unexplained (on the other hand there were so many
    choices that it would've been hard to justify all), the majority
    seemed reasonable. Validity and robustness for me are hard to
    assess, but I based my numbers on the discussion about uncertainties
    and the sensitivity analysis.

[^5]: Major limitations around the logic and communication of the
    theoretical model of cost-effectiveness used in the paper. Minor
    limitations of readability and reporting which could have been
    addressed before publication (such as reporting 95% CIs without
    medians, and not reporting overall cost and benefit estimates)

[^6]: Both excellent, but because the paper is so dense it's sometimes
    hard to follow.

[^7]: Provided models are shared with any reader who asks, I couldn't
    ask for more here. Limitations of survey replicability (particularly
    E model) prevent perfect score

[^8]: The large uncertainty and a reduced score for replicable is due to
    the various data sources/references used in the quantification of
    the models. Many can be recovered from other papers which may or may
    not be replicable/straight forward. A table with all data sources
    and functional relationships would've been useful. Also a bit more
    info on model E would help reduce my uncertainty here.

[^9]: I'd be surprised if I ever read a paper with more relevance to
    global priorities, although as mentioned there are a few version of
    this argument circulating such as Denkenberger & Pearce (2016)

[^10]: Biased by the knowledge that it has been published and my trust
    in the reviewing process.
