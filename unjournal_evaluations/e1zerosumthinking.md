# Abstract 

At its core, this paper formalizes and tests a theory posing that the
poor are poor because they do not work hard enough. I describe
conceptual, theoretical, and empirical issues.

# Summary Measures

*Manager's note*: we are not posting *all* of this evaluators
quantitative ratings and predictions as they did not seem to use our
scales in the intended way. Their aggregate and overall normative
ratings were very low, i.e., very negative.

# Written report

## Summary

In a series of papers in the 1960s, anthropologist George Foster
introduced a "theory" of development based on what he called "the image
of limited good", which, for the purpose of this evaluation, can be
summarized as follows. Zero-sum environments are more conducive to
effort-suppressing beliefs, which in turn lead to less effort and
subsequent economic development. The paper under evaluation, henceforth
CBHNW, provides a theoretical representation of Foster's hypothesis
along with empirical tests in support of their theory.

CBHNW states that "by providing a formal theory that builds on Foster's
insights and testing its predictions, we establish a strong link between
zero-sum thinking, demotivating beliefs, and economic activity in
small-scale non-industrial societies as well as industrialized
societies." This would indeed contribute to our understanding of
economic development. However, in this evaluation I argue that this
paper fails to establish such a link---conceptually, theoretically, and
empirically. Hence, CBHNW provides no contribution to our understanding
of economic development. Instead, the significant amount of time and
effort devoted to following Foster's old ideas is a gloomy reminder that
(some) research in economic development still builds on the idea that
the poor are poor because they do not try hard enough.

## Conceptual issues

CBHNW is based on George Foster's ideas, which were received with much
criticism even soon after publication in 1965 (Kennedy,
1966[@nnxw1i8ww8w]; Acheson, 1972[@nzy7q90dt8t]; Acheson,
1974[@n3v4wqizl3f]). That is to say, my criticism is far from novel.
CBHNW, however, does not acknowledge (nor engage with) this academic
debate. If the aim of CBHNW is simply to "provide a theoretical
representation of Foster's hypothesis", the remaining of this subsection
is irrelevant; convincingly or not, they did it. I presume, however,
that the goal of this rather comprehensive paper is more ambitious.
Thus, I must start by discussing Foster's ideas.

Let us start with some context. Foster was a relatively wealthy
anthropologist from the United States, who developed his ideas, mostly,
by interpreting what he saw, read, and heard about life in very small
and poor villages in Mexico. From his necessarily skewed viewpoint in
small villages in Mexico, he then made inferences towards "peasant
societies" in general.

The first part of his argument is that "peasants" share a mindset in
which "the cake" is fixed, which means that to get a larger piece, one
must take it away from someone else. The second part of the argument is
that this zero-sum environment leads to a "cognitive orientation" in
which people avoid standing out since their success would be perceived
as someone else's downfall. The evidence in support of these arguments
is, under the most generous interpretation, very weak. Instead, a
critical reading of his work indicates that Foster had a preconceived
idea in his mind, shaping a mold into which he would then squeeze his
observations through far-fetched interpretations. For example, to
support his idea of the "fixed cake" mindset of the "peasants", Foster
extends the idea to noneconomic aspects of life, leading to arguments
such as that "a mother's ability to love her children is viewed as
limited by the amount of love she possesses" (Foster, 1965; p.298). He
also states that "it is a truism that health is a 'good' that exists in
limited quantities" (Foster, 1965; p.299), based on observations such as
that "the loss of blood and semen is said to be considered permanently
debilitating in some areas" (Kennedy, 1968); one wonders who is
benefiting from the loss of blood and semen. In summary, there is much
to be said about Foster's work. My aim is not to critique his work in
detail---that has been done since the 1960s---but it is useful to expose
the weakness of the arguments leading to the foundation of the theory of
economic development in CBHNW.

CBHNW stated goal forces the authors to be more precise than Foster,
which leads to additional conceptual concerns. I present a selection.
According to CBHNW, envy is an effort-suppressing belief. That is,
people may *choose* to work less hard and accumulate less wealth to
avoid the envy of their peers. Surprisingly, this is presented as a
fact. To me, the opposite seems more likely; people may work harder in
response to their own feelings of envy. Indeed, after a quick search, I
was able to find research in favor of the role of envy as a motivator
but not on its role as demotivator (e.g., Salerno et al.,
2019[@nsx0d9d1elo]). Furthermore, I also found research on the
evolutionary advantage provided by envy (Hill et al., 2011). The closest
work in support of envy as demotivator is on people *hiding* their
success for the sake of social harmony, which is not the same as
suppressing effort (Arnett and Sidanius, 20183[@n2cafzyqkat]). Thus,
envy, which is the main belief explore is not even unequivocally
effort-suppressing.[^1] The second effort-suppressing belief in CBHNW is
witchcraft, which is the reductionist way chosen to describe
"traditional religious beliefs". More specifically, the authors refer to
the "evil eye", which is a fairly universal belief that people can harm
other people by giving them a "bad look"---typically driven by envy.
Critically, a belief in the evil eye does not necessarily lead to less
effort, it suffices to hide the success. Finally, CBHNW deals with the
degree of zero-sumness of the environment. It remains unclear, however,
whether they refer to the actual environment or the perception of the
environment. The theory implies the former, yet the empirics focus on
the latter. Furthermore, there is an implicit assumption that all
members of a given society are exposed to or perceive the same
zero-sumness. In practice, the poor may rightfully feel like their
environment is zero-sum, while the rich may feel the opposite. This
heterogeneity may explain much of the empirical evidence presented in
the paper.

Finally, CBHNW proposes a novel account to partly explain why the Global
North is richer than the Global South. They argue, emphasis is mine,
that

> "Europe's global expansion and colonialism after 1500 CE---including
> the **Columbian Exchange**---may have reduced zero-sum thinking
> through the emergence of new trading opportunities (..). an inflow of
> new technologies and resources, like new crops (...),
> fertilizers/guano (...), and stimulants like sugar, coffee, and tea
> (...), and a perception of limitless, though not unoccupied, land.
> Unleashed by colonialism and aided by the devastating impact of
> Eurasian diseases, this shock may have opened an exit ram from the
> trap to zero-sum thinking. According to our theory, such effects could
> have triggered a cultural shift to a less demotivating belief system
> accompanied by **higher effort exertion** and more learning-by-doing.
> This cultural shift could have ushered in technological breakthroughs
> and a transition to modern, intensive economic growth." (p.45)

Let us take a minute to consider what this quote says.[^2] Europe's
colonialism, in which they grew richer by directly *taking away* from
others, taught them that the world is not zero-sum---even if they were
literally taking resources away from the local populations. This
newfound realization led to a cultural shift in which they were less
prone to hold demotivating beliefs, such as envy. With less envy, thus
morally superior according to the christian tradition, Europe got a new
powerful work ethic. Finally, through hard work, Europe got richer. Yes.
Somehow, CBHNW argues that the "Great Divergence" stems from Europe's
industrious nature instead of their loot. The implication being that the
Global South is poor because they did not work hard enough, not because
Europeans brought diseases that wiped out the many advanced societies
that existed in, for example, America.[^3]

Let me be clear, the poor are not poor because they do not try hard
enough. To the skeptical reader, I propose the following thought
experiment. Suppose there is a community with 100 residents all with
similar wealth. One day, one half of the residents take the other half's
property, resources, and labor with no legal consequences. Five
generations later everyone is relatively free and living under a common
rule of law in the same community. Naturally, the descendants of the
sacked half are significantly poorer. Would the origin of the great
divergence be a mystery? No, the origin is the "exchange" five
generations ago.

## Theoretical issues

Given the conceptual issues listed in the previous subsection, I do not
see the value of formalizing Foster's ideas. For those who may see some
value, I provide a brief critique of the theory taking the premise as
given.

CBHNW claims that "Evolutionary models are underutilized in economics".
This is not a positive but a normative statement, which may explain the
authors' modeling choice as a preference. Beyond this sign and the
stated importance "to have theory (and predictions) in a setting where
values and beliefs are in motion and not assumed to be fixed or in some
stable equilibrium" (p.2), there is no additional discussion on the
appropriateness of their modeling choice.

My concern is the way in which players interact with each other, that
is, through production in matched pairs. This type of interaction, while
convenient for an evolutionary model, implies a rather strange
institutional framework. Presumably, in the small-scale economies in
Foster's study-sites, there was a substantial degree of subsistence
farming and some local markets. Today, most people interact in a market.
Without a convincing discussion on the ways in which the chosen
evolutionary model is a good approximation to more realistic scenarios,
it is hard to interpret the scope of the theoretical predictions. In its
current form, every prediction should be qualified by "assuming paired
production".

## Empirical issues

The empirical section of the paper aims to test the predictions from the
theory, which I have argued is set on an unrealistic framework of paired
production. What we may learn from these tests about the actual world
remains an open question. Here, I limit myself to point out a few issues
in the empirical section.

-   There is significant subjectivity in the way in which abstract
    concepts are represented. For example, the validation exercise
    (p.24) reveals that seemingly minor differences in the zero-sum
    index can lead to radically different views of the world, which begs
    the question on whether the index is truly capturing the abstract
    concept. Here, it may be useful to present the distribution of the
    index, which is only present for the cross-country data.

-   Effort is the key variable linking development with beliefs in the
    theory, yet there is no true measure of effort. Instead, CBHNW
    argues that education is a good proxy. That is simply not true, the
    best predictor of a person's education level is simply the parents'
    education level. Hence, the empirics are missing the key link to
    development.

-   The theory implies a causal story, yet all empirics rely on
    association.

-   In page 20, the statements are presented in pairs, but it is not
    clear whether one of each pair is randomly presented. If so, it
    would be useful to see results by type of framing. I would, for
    example, expect a very different answer from "Gaining happiness
    requires taking it away from others" and "It is possible for
    everyone to be happy".

-   Also related to the statements starting in page 20 used to build the
    zero-sum index, the first statement in each pair seems driven by
    envy, which means that the regression of the envy and the zero-sum
    index is simply showing that more envious people are more likely to
    have envious views. This type of open interpretation is common to
    most regression.

-   In page 32, "The second measure captures the respondent's view of
    whether the poor can escape poverty **through effort**: 'In your
    opinion, do most poor people in this country have a change of
    escaping from poverty, or is there very little change of
    escaping?'". I note that nowhere in the question is there any
    reference to effort.

-   Table 4, every variable is a proxy for income, which again is better
    predicted by parents' income. As I mentioned elsewhere, given the
    high levels of inequality throughout the world, it is feasible for
    the poor to perceive the world as zero-sum, while the rich perceive
    the world as non-zero-sum. Perhaps the authors can run robustness
    tests ruling out the effect of inequality.

-   Figure 5 and 6. The hump shape can also be explained by ex-post
    rationalization. In Figure 6, for example, the poorest decile worked
    hard, and it did not pay off, thus, work does not bring success. For
    the richest decile, it is convenient to belief that their standing
    comes from work instead of the most likely scenario, they were born
    into the richest decile in the first place.

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, I do not see a way to make this paper better. It is a
shame that so much time and effort was spent for the sake of Foster's
patronizing ideas.

[^1]: The authors may want to address the following puzzle. If
    development is constrained by envy, should we not expect growth
    after the forceful imposition of christianity in much of the Global
    South? After all, envy is one of their so-called seven deadly sins.

[^2]: Note that the Columbian "Exchange" was not so much an exchange but
    a violent imposition. Language matters, particularly in work in
    development.

[^3]: Surprisingly, CBHNW presents rather weak evidence in support of
    their story, such as the relative usage of the word "progress",
    which they puzzlingly classify as a non-zero-sum concept.
