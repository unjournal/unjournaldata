# **Written Report**

This paper uses a randomized controlled trial to show that a World Bank
program introducing performance pay, auditing, and feedback raised
operating efficiency and reduced infant mortality in non-profit health
centers in the DRC. Treatment and control health centers received equal
increases in funding. A matching diff-in-diff analysis comparing
treatment and control health centers against those not in the experiment
shows that increased funding alone increases the number of employees and
services offered but does not affect efficiency or infant mortality.
Effects appear only after about 7 quarters, suggesting that the
"feedback" component of the program was important for teaching health
center managers how to meet the incentivized performance targets.

This is a very nicely executed paper on an important and policy-relevant
topic, and it was a pleasure to read. RCTs this big are somewhat rare,
and obtaining access to administrative outcome can be difficult. To
combine both of these features in a context as understudied as the DRC
is a real achievement. My congratulations to the authors. I think the
paper is very good, and I hope the comments that follow can be useful in
helping the authors clarify and improve the paper even further.

My main comment is that I would have liked more discussion of the
details of the treatment, especially early on in the paper. The intro
refers to "performance-based incentives and feedback" without mentioning
exactly which players are receiving the incentives and the feedback. The
recent literature on the personnel economics of the state (e.g. Finan
Olken Pande 2017) shows that there are lots of choke points in the
bureaucracy where service delivery can break down -- administrators,
managers, and frontline providers can each fail to perform as desired.
It's important that your readers know which of these you are taking aim
at, and why you think that's the right part of the system to target.

-   By the end of the paper I had learned that the incentives and
    feedback were provided to the managers (owners?) of the health
    centers. It would be helpful to have more background about these
    people, their world, and their incentives.

-   You characterized the health centers as non-profits; does this mean
    they are funded by donors? Are they Western or local organizations?
    Given that the state seems quite interested in their operation,
    would it make sense to think of them as government contractors?
    Locating the readers in the economic decisions faced by these
    operators in the status quo can help us interpret the program's
    effect more clearly. You note that non-profit and for-profits are
    different, but I think it would be nice to be explicit about exactly
    who has different incentives, how are they different, and what
    predictions does that lead to.

-   I would have liked more detail earlier on in the intro about exactly
    which actors are getting the performance-based pay and the feedback,
    and why they are the ones who need it. Is it the managers, the
    owners, the frontline employees? The interpretation of the paper
    depends crucially on this. I'd love to see a discussion of it in the
    intro.

-   The characterization of the treatment itself confused me a bit. The
    paper groups "auditing and feedback" together, and suggests that the
    auditing in question is an audit of the feedback, meant to
    strengthen the reliability of the information which the health
    centers receive as feedback (p.1). But page 11 gives the impression
    that the auditing in question is being done on the information
    provided by the health centers to the central authority (the
    "community verification system". \[What incentives do communities
    have to report malfeasance, if their community health center will
    get more funding for reporting inflated numbers?\] Page 11 also
    mentions a procurement and contracting reform that seems to have
    been part of the treatment. I think the paper would be well-served
    by a much more nitty-gritty, hard-headed explanation of the full
    accountability treatment and how each element of it fits into the
    theory of change.

-   Along these lines, I think the paper would benefit from a fuller
    picture of the possible set of mechanisms (even while I recognize
    that the experiment wasn't set up to really nail down mechanisms).
    For example: You note an increase in the number of services
    performed -- what are the different ways that could happen? Is it
    that demand increases because quality increases? Is it that nurses
    and doctors are more likely to show up to work? Is it that nurses
    are going out to drum up demand among customers? Is it that services
    that are already happening are more likely to be recorded? Anything
    you can do to distinguish between these mechanisms is of course
    welcome, but even just enumerating the possible mechanisms would be
    really helpful -- remember the readers know next to nothing about
    the context!

It\'s great that you report outcomes from administrative data, but given
that the treatment incentivized outcomes reported by the health centers
themselves, a bit more work is in order to convince the reader that the
data are reliable.

-   It sounds like the main outcomes you look at are NOT those on which
    the incentives were based (which is good!), but you should make this
    clearer. I didn't find that explicitly stated until Appendix D!

-   It would be nice to know something about the outcomes that were
    incentivized. Even though it makes sense not to make these your main
    outcomes, showing effects on them would be an important
    "manipulation check" to understand if the treatment works in the
    expected way. (Going back to the paper again, I see that it looks
    like the best you can do on this is Figure A4/Table A8. But even
    that is helpful, and I'm glad you've included it.)

-   You mention the audits and counter audits of these incentivized
    outcomes -- it'd be nice to see how prominent fraud was (if, of
    course, you have access to the data -- you may not).

-   As a further "manipulation check" on how the program operated: it
    would be nice to see how the funds disbursed evolved over time, or
    perhaps what fraction of centers qualified for funding over time
    (and also for control centers if you can). This could help tell the
    story about how crucial the feedback/learning element of the program
    was -- if you have the data.

-   Would love to see how the program affected performance on metrics
    that were NOT related to the incentivized ones. You cite Holmstrom
    and Milgrom but it would be really great to explicitly measure
    whether multitasking is a problem here.

Finally, I think a basic cost-benefit analysis would be really helpful
here.

-   What's the total cost of the program? How much more expensive is it
    to give out conditional cash (with auditing and procurement reforms)
    than unconditional cash?

-   How much does it cost to save each life? How does this compare with
    other interventions in the literature?

Small comments -- mostly on framing, most simply a matter of taste.

-   You note that "a large share" of health services in poor countries
    are provided by non-profits -- how big is that share? I realize it
    may be hard to get an extremely authoritative answer due to data
    limitations, but anything you can do to show what a big part of the
    sector you're speaking to would be helpful.

-   This feature is really cool: that the control health centers receive
    on average the same funding as the treatment ones, but the funding
    is unconditional. I think it's worth highlighting more.

-   You're really interested in employees' "motivation," and how they
    might get "overwhelmed" by P4P structure. I get it; that's the focus
    of the Huillery and Seban paper, and they have to figure out what's
    behind a surprising negative result. But I think you don't need to
    emphasize this so much, and your data don't really allow you to
    speak to motivation anyway; it seems like enough to say that
    employees need both feedback and incentives to succeed, and neither
    is sufficient on its own.

-   The DiD on the "outside group" is really clever; I wish more RCTs
    did this. I love Table 6. One small caveat: I don't think you can
    say that "governance alone improves operating efficiency" (p. 30)
    because you don't see any health centers that get governance WITHOUT
    funding -- it may be that funding is a necessary condition for the
    governance to work.

-   You're focused on drawing the contrast between P4P in a social
    context vs a for-profit context, but I think a lot of people will be
    interested in this paper who care about P4P in the (social) context
    of public economics, especially education. My read of the evidence
    from P4P in education is that it seems to work pretty well in poor
    countries (e.g [@temp_id_8480435626055092]) and that a big part of
    the effect is the selection of teachers (e.g.
    [@temp_id_7500792962905438]), ([@temp_id_36102387472838116]).
    There's also work showing, similarly to your paper, that P4P is
    often not enough on its own ([@temp_id_819910487450977]). I think
    including a brief discussion of how your work relates to the P4P
    literature in education, and what makes the health context
    different, would expand your audience.

-   I think you do an admirable job motivating why the effects of this
    "bundled" treatment are interesting, even though ideally we would
    want to know which pieces of the bundle matter most. You may also be
    interested in another recent paper that achieved big gains by
    bundling a lot of things together (also in the education space, from
    Guinea-Bissau): [@temp_id_725685966267638].

-   There's nothing inherently wrong with having a treatment group so
    much bigger than the control group, but since it's so unusual you
    may want to explain why -- were there originally multiple treatment
    arms? Were there just not very many eligible health centers relative
    to funding available?
