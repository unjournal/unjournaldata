# Abstract 

\[Here we will include the \~75 word, 400 character summary that we will
request evaluators to provide. Otherwise, we will use an LLM-generated
summary (and note this is the case).\]

***\[Here, we offer a template for hosting Unjournal evaluations in
PubPub, version 6. ****This template can also be used for sharing with
authors (as a draft), for their response, before the full package is
released. This template is for the Unjournal Applied and Policy
stream\]*

***\[To proceed...***[^1]*\]*

# Note: Applied and Policy Stream

This paper was evaluated as part of our "applied and policy stream",
described
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwkmGJtaOcryK-tJs3mrs6DIAj411YRnsauaj6EE6WY/edit#heading=h.o7xzpvh0h0b2 "null").
The ratings should not be directly compared to those in our main
academic stream.

# Summary Measures

We asked evaluators to give some overall assessments, in addition to
ratings across a range of criteria. *See the *[*evaluation summary
"metrics"*](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/7s6czeed/draft?access=sl91tfox#metrics "null")*
\[link evaluation summary draft, view mode, 'metrics' header\] for a
more detailed breakdown of this. See these ratings in the context of all
Unjournal ratings, with some analysis, in our *[*data presentation
here.*](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation_data_analysis.html#basic-presentation "null")[^2]*

**Overall assessment: **We asked evaluators to rank this paper
"heuristically" as a percentile "relative to applied and policy research
you have read aiming at a similar audience, and with similar goals." We
requested they "consider all aspects of quality, credibility, importance
to future impactful applied research, and practical relevance and
usefulness."
