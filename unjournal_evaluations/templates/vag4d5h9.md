# Abstract 

\[Here we will include the \~75 word, 400 character summary that we will
request evaluators to provide. Otherwise, we will use an LLM-generated
summary (and note this is the case).\]

***\[Here, we offer a template for hosting Unjournal evaluations in
PubPub, version 6. ****This template can also be used for sharing with
authors (as a draft), for their response, before the full package is
released.\]*

***\[To proceed...***[^1]*\]*

# Summary Measures

We asked evaluators to give some overall assessments, in addition to
ratings across a range of criteria. *See the *[*evaluation summary
"metrics"*](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/7s6czeed/draft?access=sl91tfox#metrics "null")*
\[link evaluation summary draft, view mode, 'metrics' header\] for a
more detailed breakdown of this. See these ratings in the context of all
Unjournal ratings, with some analysis, in our *[*data presentation
here.*](https://unjournal.github.io/unjournaldata/chapters/evaluation_data_analysis.html#basic-presentation "null")[^2]*

**Overall assessment **(See footnote[^3])

**Journal rank tier, normative rating (0-5): ** On a 'scale of
journals', what 'quality of journal' should this be published in?[^4]
*Note: 0= lowest/none, 5= highest/best. *

# Claim identification and assessment [^5]

*\[Note to content posters: only include these sections and subsections
where there is content present\] *

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^6] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

...

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^7] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^8] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^9] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

# Written report

*\[Editor: Incorporate the evaluator's full report here. \]*

1.  *'Import' this using PubPub tools into a blank 'pub' before
    including the rest of the content *

2.  *Many formats can be incorporated, but you may need to adapt these.
    Please try to capture headers, add citations, etc.*

# Evaluator details

1.   What is your research field or area of expertise, as relevant to
    this research? \[Skip if they did not answer this question\]

2.  How long have you been in your field of expertise?

    -   ...

3.  How many proposals, papers, and projects have you evaluated/reviewed
    (for journals, grants, or other peer-review)?

    -   ...

[^1]: Create a new 'pub', import evaluator's content, copy in the
    material below, filling in as necessary, and checking/adjusting to
    maintain the desired formatting. 'Pub settings' will need adjusting.
    Pub settings will also need to be configured. See our internal Coda
    documentation.

[^2]: Note: if you are reading this before, or soon after this has been
    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^3]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have
    encountered in the last three years." We requested they "consider
    all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge
    production, and importance to practice.

[^4]: See ranking tiers discussed
    [here](https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/the-unjournal-project-and-communication-space/policies-projects-evaluation-workflow/evaluation/guidelines-for-evaluators#journal-ranking-tiers).

[^5]: This comes from the form. If the author didn't do this, please
    skip this section.

[^6]: The evaluator was given the following instructions: Identify the
    most important and impactful factual claim this research makes --
    e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^7]: "Feel free to express this in terms of the probability of the
    claim being true or as a credible interval for the parameter being
    estimated."

[^8]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^9]: *We asked:* \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of
    the above claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do
    you \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy
    choices? Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the
    evaluation manager in some cases. As an example of an
    \'implication\' \... in a global health context, the \'main claim\'
    might suggest that a vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up,
    would save lives at a \$XXXX per life saved.
