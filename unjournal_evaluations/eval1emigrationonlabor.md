# Abstract [^1]

The paper sought to examine the effects of emigration on rural labour
markets, specifically, how outmigration transforms rural labour markets
\[using an experiment involving a transport subsidy intervention\].
Using a sample of 5,792 potential seasonal migrants across 133 villages,
the authors observed that transport subsidies increased beneficiaries'
income \[and this\] generated spillover effects. The research findings
indicate that the transport subsidies increase beneficiaries' income due
to better employment opportunities and also generated some spillovers.
\[These included\] increasing individual take-up rate as a result of a
higher density offers which induces those connected to the offered
recipients to also migrate, the village emigration rate increases,
increase in the male agriculture wage rate in the village increasing
income earned in the village. \[...\]There is a decrease in the price of
non-tradeables such as prepared food and tea while net food prices
increase. The paper contributes immensely to the research on migration
and labour studies. It also provides practical insights on intervention
and adds useful value to research on interventions and has policy
implications. The immense contribution is attributed to policy
implications of the effects of subsidies on intervention and how the
impact positively on such interventions. The practical insight is
demonstrated by how recipients receive such interventions when they are
directly involved and whatever benefits such as the subsidies go to them
directly to achieve the desired results.

# Written report

## Introduction

Whilst the topic is clearly explained, authors may consider replacing
the word "effects" with "impact:. An impact is an effect, but not all
effects are impacts. Since authors cannot measure all effects and
therefore models often developed tend to be parsimonious, using "impact"
may be more appropriate in my opinion. Again, the authors, in their
summary of income, wage and labour supply used "effects" 5.3, 5.4, and
5.5, and as I have indicated above that an impact is an effect I will
advise accordingly.

The authors did a good job of motivating the problem statement and the
objectives in the introduction which are reasonable and able to meet the
objectives set based on the data available.

## Literature

Whilst the \[literature\] review was broad, it lacked comprehensiveness.
\[It included\] a lot of review of empirical studies, however, the
theoretical framework was not adequate. I expected, for example, that
the Harris-Todaro theory and model on rural migration \[would be\]
adequately reviewed, not just in passing.

## Methodology and Data

The \[theoretical\] models were clear and formalize the argument given
by the author as in the statement of the problem while they relate well
with the objectives set. However, the models do not incorporate clearly
all the aspects of reality which are very important to our audience.

Though treatment effects modelling was incorporated, a decomposition and
counterfactual model should \[also\] have been incorporated. The
Generalized Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition or the Fairlie decomposition
(in the case the outcome variable is discrete) is recommended to deal
with this shortfall. Again, variables that cover individual
characteristics should have been incorporated in the model. It must be
emphasized that the decision for a labor\[er\] to migrate may not
necessarily \[only\] be influenced by transport subsidy but \[also by\]
other factors including one's gender, sex, marital status, education,
age, etc.[^3]

*\[On the* *Oaxaca or Fairlie decomposition...*\] measures the
emigration gap between subsidy beneficiaries and those without
subsidies. It will also indicate the extent to which the gap is
influenced by the subsidy (unexplained factors) differences in
endowments (characteristics) among the two of which the absolute values
of the explained (characteristics) and unexplained (in this case, the
subsidy) will determine which largely influences the emigration
decision.

## Analysis and discussion of results

The model being estimated is clear and relates with the objectives.
Though the author found no usefulness in determining whether the
migration experience of those travelling from a high intensity village
is more successful than those from a low intensity village between
migrants and non-migrants, this could have been observed with migrants
alone.

*\[Clarification\] *On page 20, authors indicate "ITT estimates report
average effects combining migrants and non-migrants, **and are therefore
not useful** for determining whether the migration experience of those
traveling from high density villages is more successful than that of
migrants from low density villages." Though this is not part of the
objectives such analysis could have been observed with migrants alone.

The author also could have examined differences in individual endowments
among the migrants and non migrants as the willingness to migrate may be
determined by individual characteristics and not the transport subsidy
alone. Again, comparison between those who are offered subsidies and
those who were not should have included decomposition and counterfactual
analysis as well as measuring the wage gap among them to critically
examine the push factors apart from using the transport subsidy as a
sole factor.

... what if other factors, other than the subsidies, or including the
subsidies could be the driving force of emigration?

[^3]: Managers note:  I think the authors indeed recognise that the
    migration decision may be influenced by a range of factors. See
    sidebar comment and evaluation manager's summary on this.
