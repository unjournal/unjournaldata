# Abstract [^1]

This paper [@nvoqobdnhwt] investigates the impacts of relatively
low-cost, small-scale, river-based irrigation in Mali, finding broadly
positive and sustained effects on agricultural productivity and
nutrition, and reduced conflict in the closest communities. On the other
hand, they find *negative* spillovers on surrounding areas. Unjournal
evaluators gave mixed ratings, with E1 giving an overall assessment of
75/100 and E2 giving 46/100 (percentiles relative to comparable
research). Both appreciated the novel combination of spatial and survey
data. Both expressed at least some confidence in the basic results:
increased agricultural output (E1 strongly believed this claim), and
improved nutritional status of children in the same area (E2 considered
this "credible"). E2 expressed substantial doubts regarding the causal
interpretation, seeking more "context-specific information on the causal
pathway" and investigation of *mechanisms* to inform future "investment
and program design." They also raised specific concerns with the data
and measurement, e.g., arguing that "the surveys tend to use recall on
household caloric intake rather than important nutrition
indicator\[s\]". E1 made concrete suggestions for improvements and
robustness checks, recommending an updated TWFE methodology and more
careful quantification of the output effect "in an area with a larger
buffer around the irrigation system". We, the evaluation managers, raise
further identification concerns, including the potential for
migration/residential sorting to bias the estimated impact on human
outcomes, the potential endogeneity in the timing of irrigation programs
(e.g., selection based on decreasing conflict risk), and the need to
verify pre-trends are tightly bounded around zero, rather than merely
statistical insignificant (see "[issues meriting further
evaluation](https://unjournal.pubpub.org/pub/evalsumirrigationresilience#issues-meriting-further-evaluation "null")"
below). Nonetheless, we believe that these findings are relevant to
policy, highlighting the potential of small-scale irrigation to
contribute to climate change adaptation, subject to important caveats
about spillovers, identification, and the need for more evidence on
whether irrigated areas show greater resilience to weather shocks. To

# Evaluation summaries

## Anonymous evaluator 1

This was a very interesting paper with evident care taken to use novel
data sources for careful analysis of irrigation and climate resilience.
This paper uses detailed data on the exact boundaries of irrigated sites
in Northern Mali combined with remotely-sensed data on farm production,
water availability, vegetation condition, precipitation, and temperature
to estimate the impact of these small-scale, river-based, irrigation
investments on agricultural output. A particularly novel aspect of this
paper is that it estimates the relationship between irrigation and
agricultural outcomes in a conflict zone, where traditional data
gathering is likely to be a challenge. The authors use Two Way Fixed
Effects to estimate these results, following recent work on
heterogeneous treatment effects in TWFE. \
\
The authors demonstrate that Normalized Deviation Water Index (NDWI),
which is interpreted as water available to crops, significantly
increases after irrigation is introduced, with no evidence of a
significant pre-trend. Similarly, the authors find a large increase in
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (a measure of plant green-ness or
vegetation health) during the rainy seasons after irrigation was
introduced. This is consistent with results of qualitative work
suggesting rice yields increased significantly. This is also
complemented by increased nutrition from DHS for children living near
the irrigation projects. There are some negative effects on child
nutrition and agricultural employment more than 4km away from the
project. Irrigation also appears to be related to conflict, with sites
experiencing significantly \[fewer\] conflict events immediately at the
perimeter, with a slight increase in conflict further away.

## Anonymous evaluator 2

One of the article's strengths is offering a longer time horizon of
analysis of smallholder irrigation, which gives insights beyond
localized case studies or pilot plots. Another value is that the authors
connect spatial data across water, agriculture and nutrition, to provide
insight beyond water efficiency or yield gains. The analysis on
longer-term livelihood outcomes may be beneficial for potential
decision-making on irrigation policy. However, the article has
shortcomings in terms of causal factors and control areas for
comparison. For example, \[are\] the differences in nutritional outcomes
related to improved income, increased household consumption of own
produce, changes in dietary behavior, market development, or other
factors? Context-specific information on the causal pathways are
critical for investment and program design.

# Evaluation managers' discussion 

## Issues meriting further evaluation

*Note, 18 Sep 2025: The points in this subsection come from the
evaluation managers, Ben Balmford and David Reinstein. We have not
shared these with the authors before posting, but we will do so now. *

As evaluation managers, we wanted to highlight some issues in the paper
that the evaluators did not discuss in detail.

Evaluator 2's interpretation of "causality" seems closer to what
economists would call an exploration of mechanisms, rather than
causality in the strict sense of identifying an unbiased estimate of the
treatment effect of an intervention. From an economics perspective, the
assumptions underlying the DiD strategy are not directly challenged in
their review. Instead, their suggestions are more about clarifying
mechanisms by which irrigation has its impacts in this context. Their
evaluation highlights the importance of understanding mechanisms for
assessing the generalisability and policy relevance of the findings; and
ensuring that the measured outcomes are policy relevant. In
"econ-speak," their concerns reinforce the point that identifying
mechanisms is crucial not for establishing causality per se, but for
understanding how and where impacts might translate across settings.

On causal interpretation, however, we as evaluation managers are
somewhat concerned that the irrigation projects could plausibly have
been established in particular places and times - for instance, possibly
contemporaneous with reductions in (very) local conflict risk or
alongside other interventions. If the timing of sites is endogenous,
then the credibility of DiD identification is threatened - a point that
is not squarely confronted in the paper or in the evaluations. The
authors do note that "we confirm that using this quasi-experimental
approach, the timing of irrigation at a given site is not correlated
with its preceding changes in weather conditions, agricultural outcomes,
or community health." This is reassuring in ruling out some obvious
threats, but it does not fully address the possibility that site timing
or location is influenced by unobserved factors that also affect later
outcomes, or that contemporaneous policy changes overlap with
irrigation. The use of district-by-year and region-by-year FEs in
specific specifications do help alleviate these concerns, as does the
evidence that there are no concurrent, nearby, infrastructure projects.
Nonetheless, future work could gather could detail in more depth the
precise process for assignment and timing of treatment, using either
administrative or anecdotal evidence to reassure that timing is as good
as random.

Migration is another reason the measured difference in human outcomes
may not reflect the actual impact of irrigation. The authors acknowledge
this, raising the possibility of "shifts in labor and other resources
toward the newly irrigated sites", backed up by focus group discussions.
But they still report these changes in ways that loosely suggest these
are real effects in the abstract and conclusion:

-    "Children in nearby communities are less likely to be stunted or
    wasted due to the irrigation, and conflict risks decrease in the
    closest communities."

-   "our estimates on nutritional benefits from small-scale irrigation
    comport with previous finding"

If this migration (i.e., relocation) is substantial, it doesn't only
hold the potential to have "negative impacts on child nutrition and
agricultural employment in outlying areas" (and similarly for conflict
outcomes). It could also be driving the *positive* observed changes on
the treated areas -- obviously if healthier people are moving in, the
measured average human outcomes will show an increase. They take some
mitigation steps and do some robustness checks, but the concern remains.
(E.g., for children, they find that effects are strongest for those born
*after* project completion, but this still doesn't rule out selective
in‑migration of pregnant women/young families).

Their robustness checks and diagnostics are not as solid as we would
like. We want to see evidence that the concerning factors are '*likely*
to be so small as to be inconsequential'. For community health
pre‑trends they present graphs with pre-period coefficients centered
near zero and 95% confidence intervals that cover zero. But the graphs
don't make it clear whether these pre-trends are *tightly bounded around
zero*. 

Furthermore, some results seem to be missing or hidden. They state "we
do not observe differential changes in other household characteristics
coinciding with the irrigation introduction in these outlying areas,
indicating that the worse stunting and wasting rates are not likely due
to shifts in population compositions."  But we could not find any
evidence presented about these differences in the article or
supplementary materials.

# Process notes and resources

### Why we chose this paper

This paper was suggested to us by[
www.aiddata.org/](https://www.aiddata.org/ "null") (by one of the
authors) as being among their highest-value work meriting further
evaluation. (See our 'evaluating research from impact-oriented
organizations' initiative discussed[
here](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GxDjyEXCZc3pthkBb/unjournal-evaluating-1-research-output-per-relevant-ea "null"))

### Evaluation process

We shared the [linked "bespoke evaluation
notes"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxSS-ewpt0lAZeXJ6UBh2ChjNWog5eh7ynuHG1IKtCs/edit?usp=sharing "null")
with the evaluators, providing them with context and further suggestions
for evaluation work.\

### Author engagement

As noted, this paper was suggested to us by one of the authors when we
reached out to  <https://www.aiddata.org/.>

They have been very responsive and offered suggestions. They decided to
submit a brief response:

> We appreciate the reviewers and evaluation managers\' comments. While
> we strove to sufficiently isolate the plausibly exogenous
> spatiotemporal variation in the irrigation intervention to allow for
> reliable causal identification, we understand that some readers may
> still have concerns. We agree with the evaluation managers\'
> suggestion that future work could gather more details on the precise
> process of treatment assignment (recognizing that we did spend
> considerable effort toward this already). We also concur with the
> reviewers comments that further exploring all of the mechanisms behind
> our diverse results could also help readers in generalizing findings
> to other contexts.

As always if they wish to provide a longer response in the future, we
will share it here.

[^1]: This abstract was written jointly by David Reinstein and Ben
    Balmford.

[^2]: We asked them to rank this paper "heuristically" as a percentile
    "relative to all serious research in the same area that you have
    encountered in the last three years." We requested they "consider
    all aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge
    production, and importance to practice.

    publicly released, the ratings from this paper may not yet have been
    incorporated into that data presentation.

[^5]: Judge the quality of the research heuristically. Consider all
    aspects of quality, credibility, importance to knowledge production,
    and importance to practice.

[^6]: A LONG COMMENT ... Excellent as an overview, and important for
    global health, but unfortunately somewhat disappointing about ways
    to address global catastrophic risks 

    \
    \[*Editor's note: the evaluator has explained that they have not
    based their assessment on this point; we do not intend  \'Relevance
    to Global Priorities\" to factor into the overall assessment)*

[^7]: "Do the authors do a good job of (i) stating their main questions
    and claims, (ii) providing strong evidence and powerful approaches
    to inform these, and (iii) correctly characterizing the nature of
    their evidence?"\
    \
    This was on the newer form only

[^8]: For the "Claims" rating, I think the results could be closer to
    the claim that this paper addresses climate "resilience". The claim
    that these results represent resilience would be stronger if linked
    to climate shocks rather than overall agricultural productivity.

[^9]: To what extent does the project contribute to the field or to
    practice, particularly in ways that are directly or indirectly
    relevant to global priorities and impactful interventions?

[^10]: This paper provides new and interesting knowledge, and the
    application of remote sensing to generate data during a period of
    conflict is a clear advance where other traditional field data
    methods would not have been feasible. This is a notable advance to
    knowledge with clear practical implications.

[^11]: Noting that knowledge and practice should have separate ratings.
    This may contribute to the academic literature, but there are risks
    to practice from using the content without further nuance and
    critique.

[^12]: Are methods clearly justified and explained? Are methods and
    their underlying assumptions reasonable? Are the results likely to
    be robust to changes in the assumptions? Have the authors avoided
    bias and questionable research practices?

[^13]: The methods used here are reasonable and appropriate, though the
    literature on Two Way Fixed Effects is rapidly changing and other
    more recently-introduced methods might also be considered here.

[^14]: Are concepts clearly defined? Is the reasoning transparent? Are
    conclusions consistent with the evidence (or formal proofs)
    presented? Are the data and/or analysis, including tables and
    figures, relevant to the argument?

[^15]: Would another researcher be able to replicate the analysis? Are
    the method and its details explained sufficiently? Is the source of
    the data clear? Is the data made as widely available as possible,
    with clear labeling and explanation? Do the authors provide
    resources that are likely to enable future research and
    meta-analysis?

[^16]: Methods are clearly explained and links to data sources are
    precise.

[^17]: Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus
    realistic and relevant to practitioners?

[^18]: The latter ratings were merged in the newer form\
    \
    "Are the paper's chosen topic and approach likely to be useful to
    global priorities, cause prioritization, and high-impact
    interventions?"

    "Does the paper consider real-world relevance and deal with policy
    and implementation questions? Are the setup, assumptions, and focus

    benefits, etc.)?"

[^21]: The evaluator was given the following instructions:\
    \
    Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this
    research makes -- e.g., a binary claim or a point estimate or
    prediction.

    Please state the authors' claim precisely and quantitatively.
    Identify the source of the claim (i.e., cite the paper), and briefly
    mention the evidence underlying this. We encourage you to explain
    why you believe this claim is important, either here, or in the text
    of your report.

[^22]: Evaluators were asked: To what extent do you \*believe\* the
    claim you stated above? Feel free to express this either a. in terms
    of the probability of the claim being true, b. as a credible
    interval for the parameter being estimated, or c. however you feel
    comfortable.

[^23]: *We asked:*

    \[Optional\] What additional information, evidence, replication, or
    robustness check would make you substantially more (or less)
    confident in this claim?

    Feel free to refer to the main body of your evaluation here; you
    don\'t need to repeat yourself. Please specify how you would perform
    this robustness check (etc.) as precisely as you are willing. E.g.,
    if you suggest a particular estimation command in a statistical
    package, this could be very helpful for future robustness
    replication work.

[^24]: *We asked:*\
    \
    \[Optional\] Identify the important \*implication\* of the above
    claim for funding and policy choices? To what extent do you
    \*believe\* this implication? How should it inform policy choices?\
    \
    Note: this 'implication' could be suggested by the evaluation
    manager in some cases. As an example of an \'implication\' \... in a
    global health context, the \'main claim\' might suggest that a
    vitamin supplement intervention, if scaled up, would save lives at a
    \$XXXX per life saved.

    We did not ask this in the 'applied stream' as it is most likely
    redundant.\
