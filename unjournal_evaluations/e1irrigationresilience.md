# Abstract 

This was a very interesting paper with evident care taken to use novel
data sources for careful analysis of irrigation and climate resilience.
This paper uses detailed data on the exact boundaries of irrigated sites
in Northern Mali combined with remotely-sensed data on farm production,
water availability, vegetation condition, precipitation, and temperature
to estimate the impact of these small-scale, river-based, irrigation
investments on agricultural output. A particularly novel aspect of this
paper is that it estimates the relationship between irrigation and
agricultural outcomes in a conflict zone, where traditional data
gathering is likely to be a challenge. The authors use Two Way Fixed
Effects to estimate these results, following recent work on
heterogeneous treatment effects in TWFE. \
\
The authors demonstrate that Normalized Deviation Water Index (NDWI),
which is interpreted as water available to crops, significantly
increases after irrigation is introduced, with no evidence of a
significant pre-trend. Similarly, the authors find a large increase in
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (a measure of plant green-ness or
vegetation health) during the rainy seasons after irrigation was
introduced. This is consistent with results of qualitative work
suggesting rice yields increased significantly. This is also
complemented by increased nutrition from DHS for children living near
the irrigation projects. There are some negative effects on child
nutrition and agricultural employment more than 4km away from the
project. Irrigation also appears to be related to conflict, with sites
experiencing significantly less conflict events immediately at the
perimeter, with a slight increase in conflict further away.

# Claim identification and assessment [^4]

## I. Identify the most important and impactful factual claim this research makes[^5] {#i-identify-the-most-important-and-impactful-factual-claim-this-research-makes}

The authors argue that small-scale, river-based, irrigation investments
in Northern Mali significantly increase agricultural output.

## II. To what extent do you \*believe\* the claim you stated above?[^6] {#ii-to-what-extent-do-you-believe-the-claim-you-stated-above}

I strongly believe that irrigation did increase agricultural output, for
those areas where irrigation was placed.

## III. Suggested robustness checks[^7] {#iii-suggested-robustness-checks}

What would make this claim stronger is a robustness check to understand
how much of this agricultural output is being moved from surrounding
areas into the new irrigation scheme to understand the effects on the
treated area overall. I discuss at greater length in the main
evaluation, but I would like to more carefully quantify the effect on
total agricultural output in an area with a larger buffer around the
irrigation system itself.

## IV. Important 'implication', policy, credibility[^8] {#iv-important-implication-policy-credibility}

The implication here is that investments in small-scale irrigation would
increase agricultural output even in conflict-prone areas.

# Written report

## Summary

This was a very interesting paper with evident care taken to use novel
data sources for careful analysis of irrigation and climate resilience.
This paper uses detailed data on the exact boundaries of irrigated sites
in Northern Mali combined with remotely-sensed data on farm production,
water availability, vegetation condition, precipitation, and temperature
to estimate the impact of these small-scale, river-based, irrigation
investments on agricultural output. A particularly novel aspect of this
paper is that it estimates the relationship between irrigation and
agricultural outcomes in a conflict zone, where traditional data
gathering is likely to be a challenge. The authors use Two Way Fixed
Effects to estimate these results, following recent work on
heterogeneous treatment effects in TWFE.

The authors demonstrate that Normalized Deviation Water Index (NDWI),
which is interpreted as water available to crops, significantly
increases after irrigation is introduced, with no evidence of a
significant pre-trend. Similarly, the authors find a large increase in
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (a measure of plant greenness or
vegetation health) during the rainy seasons after irrigation was
introduced. This is consistent with results of qualitative work
suggesting rice yields increased significantly. This is also
complemented by increased nutrition from DHS for children living near
the irrigation projects. There are some negative effects on child
nutrition and agricultural employment more than 4km away from the
project. Irrigation also appears to be related to conflict, with sites
experiencing significantly fewer conflict events immediately at the
perimeter, with a slight increase in conflict further away.

## Major Comments

1.  My first comment relates to the framing of the paper, where the
    title emphasizes the effect on "Climate Resilience". The main
    outcomes of the paper all appear to be based on remotely sensed
    agricultural productivity which is not necessarily Climate
    Resilience, which implies more of a focus on how resilient
    livelihoods are to climate change and fluctuations. I understand
    that resilience is a broad term, but it would strengthen the claims
    to resilience (rather than simply food security) with heterogeneity
    analysis to see if the treatment effects are larger for areas
    experiencing greater anomalous dry spells, or justify the claim to
    resilience with greater emphasis on the ecological outcomes.\

2.  The main NDWI and NDVI analysis includes, if I understood correctly,
    only polygons that at some point became irrigated. Given the later
    results showing some effects on agricultural employment and child
    nutrition 4km away, I think it would be interesting to look at NDWI
    and NDVI effects in the immediate area around the irrigation
    polygon. One possibility would be defining nearby areas to consider
    using catchments, water tables, or other groundwater information.
    This would help understand how much non-irrigated farming was
    displaced to the irrigated polygon. Depending on the extent to which
    agricultural activities were shifted to the irrigated polygons, the
    increased inputs would also need to be included in
    back-of-the-envelope calculations of yield gains. If output
    increased but inputs (especially labour) also increased, the yield
    gains alone may overestimate the effect on net value of yields.\

3.  The timing of conflict events by season may offer some clues to the
    source of resentment and \[may help\] separate between pastoralists
    seeking dry-season reserve pasture or agriculturalists angry at
    below-normal water availability during their normal wet season.\

4.  The lack of statistically significant results for valorization of
    floodplains is interesting and deserves further explanation,
    especially if floodplains shift and floods become more frequent with
    climate fluctuations. Is this due to timing? If the floodplains are
    only valorized in the wake of heavy rains or flooding, do the
    authors identify these episodes and use only these episodes in their
    empirical tests? Do these results indicate that this valorization of
    mares is ineffective, or that it is too ad hoc to easily measure
    with remote sensing? The authors could report these results and
    explain whether this is a precisely-estimated null, or a noisy and
    insignificant non-zero estimate.\

5.  De Chaisemartin C, d'Haultfoeuille X. 2020. [@nafbc9f0pd9] may no
    longer be the most recent method in the TWFE literature with
    heterogeneous effects. See, for instance, the more recent Gardner et
    al 2024 [@n4s8ye1s1ok] paper:
    <https://jrgcmu.github.io/2sdd_gtty.pdf>

## Minor Comments

1.  In some places the discussion of whether the land was converted from
    unfarmed to farmed is a bit confusing - from p. 5: *"Thus, the
    irrigation impacts we find are not likely due to the conversion of
    unfarmed land to irrigated farming. \[...\] We confirm that project
    sites reflected landscapes initially classified as grassland, bare
    earth, or shrubs that were differentially converted into farmland
    after the irrigation interventions and then cultivated extensively
    over time."*

2.  Figure 1 is very detailed and contains a lot of information, but
    another zoom-in on a specific sub-region would help clarify if
    irrigation installation proceeded along the river uniformly, or if
    irrigated sites were added a bit more randomly. It looks there is a
    lot of variation in construction year at each section of the river,
    but it would be good to highlight this.
