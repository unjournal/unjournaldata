<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We’ve collected feedback from evaluators through survey questions in our evaluation forms. With over 100 completed evaluations from both academic and applied streams, we can now share insights about time commitments, evaluator experience, and process feedback.</p>

<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Evaluators spend an average of <strong>9.6 hours</strong> (median: 8 hours) on an evaluation, ranging from 3 to 32 hours. This reflects differences in paper complexity and evaluator approaches.</p>

It also took me a long time to understand the ranking process.  It would eb good if you gave a couple of worked examples.","two enthusiastic thumbs up","Good!","9.5/10","Process was clear, template was helpful.","I know there’s a revised version in the works... it was fine for me","8/10","very good","I have little confidence in the numeric ratings, but I’ll be curious to see if there’s any predictive power there. Let me know if there is!","The questions were annoying after I already spent a lot of time on the referee report. I was really ready to hit submit, but had to reason through a bunch of questions, where some were already answered in the referee report.","I would rate this very posively! The process supports a very thorough evaluation of the paper, and I enjoyed being able to provide point estimates for specific characteristics of the paper along with a more text-based peer review","This template is functiong well, although with long web questionnaires one always dreads the loss of responses due to some accident or connection failure.","The template is very helpful, I hope it is saved rightly as there is no way to save it, so was worried as I filled it during several days.","9/10","7/10","Very useful","The template and instructions were clear and helpful! I found it interesting to think about these metrics.","Favorably","A tad bit long but thorough.","Good","Rigorous and unfamiliar, but good","Above average","8/10","9/10, all clear","Not bad, I’d crib about it but that’s just me trying this out for the first time","Some of the questions were repetitive of what was included in my report","Many strengths! The numeric measures will likely not be useful until there are repeated measures for individual reviewers. I also liked the push for discussion of policy relevance. However, I think the separate smaller questions could be collapsed into the main review.","I feel it was designed for other Unjournal work and less suitable for this PQ-related work (as far as I’ve understood it anyway). So here for me the process was somewhat confusing due to many layers of the work, especially when it came down to evaluating the evaluation (D&amp;Z) of evaluation (TEAs) of data, and its evaluation (4th layer, PQ operalisation devised by Unjournal) but David was helpful clarifying expectations and providing briefs","OK - note I skipped a bunch.","9/10","Very well structured and clear","Very helpful and clear.","Pretty handy, although I I’d guess sometimes a reviewers core criticism will largely determine a lot of the fields."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Feedback<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"scrollX":true,"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-were-learning">What We’re Learning</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Time commitment is substantial but manageable</strong>: Median of 8 hours for high-quality peer review</li>
<li><strong>Evaluators are highly qualified</strong>: 10+ years experience, 100+ prior reviews</li>
<li><strong>Process needs refinement</strong>: Appreciate thoroughness but find sliders/questions cumbersome</li>
<li><strong>Strong engagement</strong>: High re-evaluation willingness indicates value despite friction</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="next-steps" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>We’re working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlining the evaluation template</li>
<li>Creating guides with worked examples</li>
<li>Improving rating interface usability</li>
<li>Reducing redundancy between written reviews and structured metrics</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Analysis of <strong>111 evaluations</strong> reveals The Unjournal successfully engages experienced researchers in substantive reviews averaging ~10 hours. While room for improvement exists—particularly around usability—evaluators remain willing to participate, suggesting we provide value justifying the time investment.</p>
